# paraphrases-generator
Paraphrases generator based on RVAE.

This is the implementation of [A Deep Generative Framework for Paraphrase Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05074) and [An End-to-End Generative Architecture for Paraphrase Generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1309.pdf).

RVAE Base: https://github.com/kefirski/pytorch_RVAE

Now it's runnable for pytorch versions 0.2 and 0.4.

Uses pretrained fastText embeddings.
