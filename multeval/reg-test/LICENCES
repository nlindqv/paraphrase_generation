MT Eval 13a is available under the public domain as it was developed by government workers on the job. Its original form is available from http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/mt/2009/ and the Michael Denkowski's version modified to skip normalization is available as part of METEOR.

multi-bleu.pl is available under the LGPL license and is distributed with Moses.

Both of these scripts are used for regression comparison only and do not play any role in MultEval scoring nor are they distributed with MultEval.
