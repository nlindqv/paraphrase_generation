and that 's the symbol of their culture . 
the last step is not so hard , but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that 's hard . 
if i make the flaps skinnier , i can use a bit less paper . 
those females are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother 's milk into their offspring , and their offspring do n't survive .

to him that phrase , `` charity begins at home , '' meant that my payday -- or someone else 's -- would just happen to coincide with his lucky day . 
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise . 
i want to share with you my latest hero , julian sanchez , a libertarian who works at the , for many people , `` evil '' cato institute . 
the license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to lucas . 
we learn those values on the left , and maybe they 'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the right . 
so we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united , and to declare that we are all still pioneers . 
we 've all , i think , become , sort of computational chauvinists , and think that computation is everything , but the mechanics still matter . 
so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people . 
in fact , i went to nashville . 
and after a few months i was writing songs . 
and this change is getting more rapid . 
the rest of our lives will be in the future . we need to prepare for it now . 
when i went traveling , i remember , i met this fabulous old man , who i met when i was caricaturing , who turned out to be an artist , in italy . 
i said , `` oh , my god . what is that ? '' 
and so for me , a mesh company , the `` classic '' mesh company , brings together these three things : our ability to connect to each other -- most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps-enabled and web-enabled -- allows us to find each other and find things in time and space . 
we have experiences in our lives , certainly , when sharing has been irresistible . 
there was none in place -- no tourist agent , no ngos , nothing -- no eyewitnesses . 
and that 's where the three kids got arrested , and that 's the grandmother of one of them . 
or , `` how can we help ? '' 
maybe there 's an innocence to it . 
i watch what people do . 
this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty . this one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this . 
that is one big peanut . since einstein is a bird , she 's very interested in things that fly . 
einstein , can you also sing ? 
e : -lrb- kissing noise -rrb- sw : and what do you say when it 's time to go ? 
and after hundreds of conversations with teenagers and teachers and parents and employers and schools from paraguay to australia , and looking at some of the academic research , which showed the importance of what 's now called non-cognitive skills -- the skills of motivation , resilience -- and that these are as important as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills -- we came up with an answer , a very simple answer in a way , which we called the studio school . 
they 'd go , `` no , no. . i do n't need one of those . 
how many people here would say that religion is important to them ? 
we 've got two million total articles across many , many different languages . 
so 10 cents a page , 300 pages in your average book , 30 dollars a book . 
but anyway , loaning out-of-print works from the boston public library , the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program , to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over . 
but nonetheless , it 's an extraordinary piece of engineering . 
there 's more than a 100 million colonies per gram , and 10 to the third power is around 1,000 . 
it will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith . 
and mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife . 
and hopefully from that i get to learn something . 
well , you have to get a little more specific than that if you 're going to build one . 
and it was time for us to go in and give it a go . 
we all went quite nuts , i will say . 
lewis thomas was a physician-writer , one of my favorite writers . 
and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there -- making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half -- and then interesting stuff , because you ca n't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery . 
they even arrived at answers , such as myths , that dominated their lives , yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth . 
`` ah ! '' say creationists . 
and her mother , demeter , goddess of the earth , is sad , and makes it cold and barren . 
and sometimes he assists that with his hands , sometimes even with the leg . 
so that was one of those cases where you let the wings go , right ? 
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself . 
polar bears are amazing hunters . 
here 's me in my office . 
it 's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear . 
we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this . 
listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music . 
so i urge you to take that path . 
but it 's around us everywhere , presumably , if it has n't been wiped out by some other process in the universe . 
here 's my multiverse creatures . 
and the teachers would write , saying , `` we 've used your videos to flip the classroom . 
we 've only just begun to analyze all of this data . 
and his pictures , everything 's accurate and it 's all to scale . 
but as we learned from samantha power , in her story about sergio vieira de mello , you ca n't just go charging in , saying , `` you 're wrong , and i 'm right . '' 
all of us are makers . 
if you do n't know what those are , they 're just the `` brains . '' 
but i think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning -- one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters , but also comes in other forms . 
it was all about cleaning up germany , and the west , and the world , and ridding it of anything unglamorous . 
yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students , a significant percentage would reject any offer that 's not close to 50\/50 . 
now we 're trying to ask , `` can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? '' 
and in fact , they say she deserves more blame in this case , the failed attempt to harm , than in another case , which we call an accident . 
it 's wonderful . 
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate . 
and this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation . 
we turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line -- a finish line , incidentally , that we never reach , but a finish line nonetheless . 
jose antonio abreu : my dear friends , ladies and gentlemen , i am overjoyed today at being awarded the ted prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers , artists and educators from venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years in founding , growing and developing in venezuela the national system of youth and children 's orchestras and choirs . 
and what did the norden bombsight do ? 
and they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them -- long extensive , months-long training sessions -- because these things are essentially analog computers ; they 're not easy to use . 
so you go from elation to depression -- there 's no depth . 
we asked meditators , who have been doing that for years and years and years , to put their mind in a state where there 's nothing but loving kindness , of course , during the training , we do that with objects . 
and just , i leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than i could ever say . 
i thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second . 
this is done entirely using , kind of , the tools that are built into second life , so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby , of course -- second life is , at the platform level , at the level of the company -- at linden lab -- second life has no game properties to it whatsoever . 
i tried to find one that did n't have a whole lot of words . 
i have a hermit crab named hawthorne , who does n't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab , so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark . 
we are blessed with a language , a system of communication , so powerful and so precise that we can share what we 've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory . 
ab : did you leave out the number 7 ? 
i know it sounds complicated ; it 's not -- i just do n't want you to think you 're seeing something out of `` rain man '' here . 
thank you very much . 
once you tell me you would like to save more in the future , let 's say every january you 're going to be saving more automatically and it 's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401 plan before you see it , before you touch it , before you get the issue of immediate gratification . 
he taught mechanics in a high school in long beach , and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems . 
and so he followed up on it . 
now we 're at 1.3 . 
they 're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified under a credible certification program . 
and i thought , but this is a place of total quiet and silence . 
i ca n't make noise . 
this is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations , the movement of these agents over into humans ; and by capturing this moment , we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early . 
those are its targets . 
now , it being encyclopedic and all , wikipedia had to do an article about star wars kid . 
and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift , that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we 've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects , or studies funded by food companies of their new products , massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they 're about to bring by market . 
you see , china under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the indian level here . 
and again , this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing . 
it kills people in the prime of their lives . 
and when i leave here , i 'm going to go back and sit in my tiny office , and my computer , and my data . 
and he studied -- there was a film about king fishers . 
co2 as a building block . 
you would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about mars , but that does n't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non-existence . 
if you fail the iq test they ask you to leave the country . 
china solves it by an edict . at some point they 'll just declare that no gasoline car will come into a city , and that will be it . 
because crime is a product of a distorted mind . 
that 's the image : african countries . but let me say this : if alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in london -- if the other people who had taken money , estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries ' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they 're able to do this , what is that ? is that not corruption ? 
standard chartered has brought in 140 million . 
what we 're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we 're developing algorithms to let people own machines , like wi-fi devices , and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle : when i 'm listening , when i 'm not using , i can help you transfer your messages ; and when you 're not using , you 'll help me transfer yours . 
ok . now , what can you do ? reduce emissions in your home . 
once it becomes a closed system , with u.s. participation , then everybody who 's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ? 
and one of the really most incredible things , i think , is that there 's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest . 
what 's going on underwater ? 
he said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that . 
and i think , you know , that 's a great name for boats that think that they 're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the gulf right now with oil at the surface . 
well , as an ornithologist , i can tell you that birds fly , and that -- and that booming a bird colony does n't do it ; it does n't do it . 
we 've been here before with energy , and people saying the economy can not withstand a switch , because the cheapest energy was slavery . 
and even though they 're used in labs to promote human lives , they 're also considered pests . 
i love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history . 
this is the new york city farm colony , which was a poorhouse in staten island from the 1890s to the 1930s . 
well , we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book . 
so , here 's how it stacks up against an entire neuron . 
and that 's really worth thinking about . 
now , let me now bring you to a wider picture , a wider picture of child mortality . 
unfortunately , that 's not the case in india . 
looks absolutely audacious . 
you are not talking about affordability , you are talking about extreme affordability . 
the best is yet to come -- so in a second . 
you like your fantasy environments , your fake , your disneyland experiences . 
right ? rendering , because you have to get your consumers -- as business people -- to percieve your offerings as authentic . 
all of a sudden having conversation and communications with the estrogens , the progesterones , saying , `` i 'm here to stay , plant me , '' building this incredible trilinear fetus that becomes , within 44 days , something that you can recognize , and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being . 
how to measure , if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small , so those planets are tectonically dead , there can not be life . 
we just need you to be authentic and real and say , `` we 're sorry . 
but it 's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do , this concept we had , was to take steven 's status , `` what is my status ? '' 
we talked about generating and using . 
the very feeling of terror is global . 
they have a mall there , the dubai mall . 
they believe they can win . 
and it actually happened again , with the fall of the berlin wall . 
it can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world . 
so , to make the point , these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash , 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons . 
we need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians . 
so despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary , we really focused on doing as little new as possible . 
the only problem is : potatoes , if you think about it , look pretty disgusting . 
another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value , which remember , is what , after all , the environmental movement needs to be about : this again is from prussia , from , i think , about 1812 , 1813 . 
yet we 've never created the opportunity for impulse saving . 
if you think it 's funny , bear in mind there is an organization called the american institute of wine economics , which actually does extensive research into perception of things , and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people , there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine , except when you tell the people how expensive it is , in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more . 
getting a new replicator is dangerous . 
well , we did pull through , and we adapted . 
the proof of this came in chile , almost a month later , when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit chile . 
all of this i 'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes , i hope . 
so i said yes to this proposition . 
but there 's another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists . 
so because the fusiform is intact , the chap can still recognize his mother , and says , `` oh yeah , this looks like my mother . '' 
but because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , `` but how come , if it 's my mother , i do n't experience a warmth ? '' 
so he came there , and i gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which i call a mirror box , right ? 
and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion , leaving remnants like that . 
we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure . 
i wrote my book , `` our final century , '' as a scientist , just a general scientist . but there 's one respect , i think , in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective , and that 's that it offers an awareness of the immense future . 
but we ca n't abandon it now ; we have to push forward , get fusion to happen . 
so , if you 've been involved in that at all , i just wanted to say : whatever you 've been doing , whether you 've just been chanting , `` raw data now ! '' 
and there are 2,000 new homes being built next to this power station . 
and i was a really good dancer . 
you do n't have to be alive . you do n't have to be even a single cell . 
and before i even let him explain , i said , `` i want to do it the right way , with the rubber bands . '' 
i used to have a list of these extinct apples , and when i would go out and give a presentation , i would pass the list out in the audience . 
digital scrotum , digital media . 
and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now . we thought there 'd be animals there ; we knew there were plants there ; the colors change , right ? 
but when we got it , now you have all the level of activity , all the benefit from it . private sector has to do it . 
and the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there -- yet they were . 
we just did not know . 
and these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about . 
and once those vessels invade the cancer , it can expand , it can invade local tissues . 
so , what else could it be ? 
but everyone on that bus is frieda . 
this is my new , purpose-built , x-ray shed . 
you become your nation . you become your religion . 
i can feel what you 're feeling as you 're feeling inside the feeling before . 
so they 're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling ; it 's a conscious pattern . it is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal . 
no , because a widely shared design practice does n't necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not `` in the dna . '' 
so this was extremely embarrassing . 
today , after 20 years of watching tv geared to make me emotional , even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes . 
as far as colleges go , there 's about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses . 
and of course , if you 're a speaker here , like hans rosling , a speaker finds this complex , tricky . but in hans rosling 's case , he had a secret weapon yesterday , literally , in his sword swallowing act . 
and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ... 
so they 're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up . 
but it 's going to have a big impact because we 're going to have niche drugs . 
and we are n't going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today . 
here 's the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit . 
the animal does not use that . 
no , you can change the charge -- they still hold on . 
the causes of this are really complicated , and i do n't have time to go into them . 
i mean , when i first got my violin and tried to play around , it was actually , really bad because it did n't sound like the way i 'd heard from other kids -- so horrible and so scratchy -- so it was n't entertaining at all . 
now here 's what does work : personalized information works . 
we should take our foot off the pedal right now , and generally we do . these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down . 
you know , the googlettes -- that 's a small project that we 're not quite sure if it 's going to work or not , but we hope it will , and if we do enough of them , some of them will really work and turn out , such as news . 
how many of you use the deskbar ? 
all right , see ? you guys should try it out . 
we also like to innovate in our physical space , and we noticed in meetings , you know , you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off , and they 're noisy , so people shut them off . 
but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide . 
it can also be used in very compelling ways for good . 
the sporting goods industry , in particular , stepped up to the plate and have done it . 
i tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers . 
sheena , there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book . 
and i felt , the one thing they do n't need , is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there . 
in 2007 , i traveled to three war zones . 
that was what he was talking about on that quote . 
it 's been reported that wikileaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world 's media combined . 
so our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we 're re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have . 
you may have the chance to make a difference . 
it is technology that has made them different , and as we see what this technology can do , we need to recognize you ca n't kill the instinct the technology produces . we can only criminalize it . 
and it 's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution . 
the reason why ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron , lives inside the equivalent of battery acid , and excretes sulfuric acid . 
but it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species , we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate dna . 
and you can do some pretty strange things because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple , if you go to cliff tabin 's lab at the harvard medical school , he 's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings . 
now , the only way we could design that , or possibly construct it , is by using a calculus-based definition of the form . 
what do you do ? 
border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here . 
and i assure you it 's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists . 
i mentioned azerbaijan before . 
i do n't think it does . i think it 's already part of a euro-turkish superpower . 
when we have extreme el nino events , you see all this red , and you see no green out here around the galapagos . 
i thought to myself , why not take the individual cells out of the pancreas -- the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes -- and transplant these cells ? -- technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting a whole organ . 
and the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change -- 4.5 times greater biomass on average , just after five to seven years . 
enric sala : thank you . 
they are like capacitors of the system . 
and on land , this can not work . 
but see all those different working things ? 
so , as soon as a crab touches them , they retract down into their shells , just like your fingernails . 
they 're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face . 
but we 'll certainly learn a lot . 
because the light-activated pore is encoded in dna , we can achieve incredible precision . 
and you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect . 
and i 'm thinking they 've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could . 
almost all of that growth will be in the developed world . 
or you can go to places like this . 
the other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects . 
this upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges . 
everybody 's moving from the east coast to the west coast . 
and it was unstable without its tail . 
so we should do everything we can , we should do everything we can to pursue it . 
and i gathered together , honestly , the world 's leading experts in every possible way . 
and they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft . tentacles . 
`` chaos city . '' 
why do i call it a book ? 
so it 's a tree , and in its trunk you have the roots of languages . 
and for other projects , like in paris , it 's about the name of the street . 
this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources . 
so i 'll show you what i mean . here we have that exact same illusion . 
he finds it . amazing . right ? 
it 's now wired -- or i should say , wireless -- by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital , in the intensive care unit , and putting it on a smartphone for physicians . 
i did n't have one of those , but i got the fitbit . 
and you can see the red dots , in this particular patient 's case , were finger sticks , which would have missed both ends . 
really , we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word . 
so if you look at security from economic terms , it 's a trade-off . 
and we 're good at it . 
and it 's a wonderful thing . 
you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want , or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it . 
they would walk around . they would play with their skirts and pants . 
that was enough . it really got the city behind it . 
the international committee of the red cross , the icrc , is talking to everyone , and it is doing so because it is neutral . 
but people live on this land . 
charles and ray liked this one because it was better . 
that 's what we all need to do . 
and likewise , the 40 billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor . 
she said , `` no , because we 've got hope now . 
and , but of course , actually , it did click . 
it means `` to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . '' 
at this point , she stops me , and she says , `` who are you ? 
no one was lost there . but the water continued to climb . 
in a sense , the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future , in probabilistic terms . 
when we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be , and that worked fine . it 's hardwired in our brains . 
and these projects will continue past these sessions , using collaborative interactive communication . 
when you study geology , you can see what 's happened in the past , and there were terrific changes in the earth . 
and one doctor said to the others , `` did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine ? '' 
employees volunteer time in the advice booth . 
i mean , if i was into boxing , like they were , then my life would n't suck . but i do n't . so it does . 
so let me start with genomics . 
but you really for the most part ca n't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person -- except in some of these special cases . 
and if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug , we see that in the blood , they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug . 
so thank you very much . 
so we 've been doing this for a couple of years , and that 's our lab . 
it 's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there , just showing up . 
and by the human spirit , i do n't mean anything divine , i do n't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic . 
you have a huge spread due to movement variability . 
so we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise . 
so what are beliefs ? 
and here 's inside the brain . 
but there 's noise added to this . 
your parents may not have planned you , but i believe god did . 
ok . what 's that all about ? well , i do know a couple of things . 
what 's in your hand ? you 've got identity ; you 've got income ; you 've got influence . 
when my little kids were little -- they 're all grown , now i have grandkids -- i used to go in and sit on the side of their bed , and i used to watch my kids sleep . 
this is fly-by , mariner iv . 
sixteen percent , by weight , of the interior contains frozen water , or ice . 
a lot of heating , frictional heating . it 's going 18 thousand miles an hour . 
and this is such an inversion , and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change . 
places that are not markets , seeding it with the principles of saturation , connectivity , low ages , etc. . 
the miracle of your mind is n't that you can see the world as it is . 
in here you see a traditional 2d architectural engineering drawing that 's used for preservation , and of course we tell the stories through fly-throughs . 
it was getting more and more apparent that we 're fighting a losing battle . 
european governments , for the most part , have n't acknowledged responsibility , and there 's nothing to kind of to push back and up against . 
it 's incredibly important , those people would no longer be alive if the united states , for instance , had n't spent that money in darfur , but it 's not a way to live . 
one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect , and that is that we 're all human . 
you may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every 22 seconds if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life . 
it is transforming the face of hunger in brazil , and it 's at scale , and it 's creating opportunities . 
because food is one issue that can not be solved person by person , nation by nation . 
that is the most effective , cost-effective , best way we can do things today . 
we can now go to the arctic . 
now , this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries . 
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i 'll go ahead and i 'll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which lance armstrong 's been a part of . 
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize winners . 
so i decided to try and write something more fun . 
people write me about their personal experience , and about their examples , and what they disagree , and nuances . 
but for half the people i added an ugly version of jerry . 
it has a flashlight , an led flashlight . 
how 's your genome today ? have you thought about it lately ? 
we can also look at , at a grander scale , what creates problems , what creates disease , and how we may be able to fix them . 
all of these things could conceivably be done , and i will tell you i 'd pretty much bet that it will be done .

it 's used as a symbol for transformation . 
what is going on in this baby 's mind ?

they 're hired -- they 're paid as professional members of the health care teams , just like doctors and nurses . 
and so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people 's behaviors do n't have the skills , do n't have the time -- our mentor mothers do . 
now , i believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this . 
he was telling the truth . because in a different culture , the dog is a surrogate for you , you know , `` today , '' `` this month , '' `` since the rainy season '' -- there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding , and so an issue here is to , in some cases , to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting , like compliance .

and it 's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you do n't notice , so that macroscopically it looks the same . 
but that 's a probabilistic statement . 
so here 's two questions for you . 
that 's because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken . 
different people trade off between standing by their outcome , faithfully holding to it , going down in a blaze of glory , or giving it up , putting their finger in the wind , and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position . 
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build . 
and this is what runs our infrastructure . 
maybe it was a career decision . i know the google geniuses i saw here -- i mean , i understand that their decision was to sell their technology at first . what if they made that decision versus to build their own culture ? how would the world be different ? 
there 's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together .

he 's incredibly fast at it , too , faster than i am , in fact . 
and there it was , the seat of human consciousness , the powerhouse of the human body , sitting in my hands . 
he just wants to get to the front row . 
and from the future self 's point of view , everything is in reverse . 
and the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away , and the nearest galaxy to us , 2.5 million light years . 
we 'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint , complex signals that our current algorithms miss . 
i mean i often think i 'm going to die in a plane , or i 'm going to die in an airport , or die jogging without an identification on me . 
man : we are the morning workers who come , all the time , here and enjoy the walking , city 's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nicest place of bangladesh . 
why is that ? 
i 'm going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life .

they 're always getting stressed . 
others in medicine dread them as well , but there 's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly . 
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories . 
so would n't it be better if we could really tell , if the surgeon could really tell , whether or not there 's still cancer on the surgical field ?

i 'll go very quickly . 
technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition . 
they showed up in five days . 
and so this is the existing city , and this is the new city . 
this one is almost humorous because it feels like i could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut . 
this is magnetic resonance imaging -- mri .

that whole dopamine-wanting system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system . 
because , are n't they vermin ? 
and based on this , people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe .

well that 's not true , but we 'll get to the goose in a minute . 
so that 's sort of the theme : big , different and gone . 
the title of my talk : shape-shifting dinosaurs : the cause of a premature extinction . 
now i assume that we remember dinosaurs . 
and there 's lots of different shapes . 
lots of different kinds . 
a long time ago , back in the early 1900s , museums were out looking for dinosaurs . 
they went out and gathered them up . 
and this is an interesting story . 
every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had . 
so if the museum in toronto went out and collected a tyrannosaur , a big one , then the museum in ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one . 
and that happened for all museums . 
so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs . 
and this was in the early 1900s . 
look at these dinosaurs . 
they 're all big . 
where are all the little ones ? '' 
and they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it : `` where are the little dinosaurs ? '' 
well , go to a museum , you 'll see , see how many baby dinosaurs there are . 
people assumed -- and this was actually a problem -- people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs , if they had juvenile dinosaurs , they 'd be easy to identify . 
but all they had were big dinosaurs . 
and it comes down to a couple of things . 
first off , scientists have egos , and scientists like to name dinosaurs . 
they like to name anything . 
everybody likes to have their own animal that they named . 
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different . 
in 1975 , a light went on in somebody 's head . 
dr. peter dodson at the university of pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do , which is different than the way reptiles grow . 
and in fact , he used the cassowary as an example . 
now think about that . 
they 're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny . 
so allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth . 
so this was a problem , and peter dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs then called hypacrosaurus . 
and he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like , if it grew in sort of a linear fashion , it would have a crest about half the size of the adult . 
but the actual sub-adult at 65 percent had no crest at all . 
so this was interesting . 
so this is where people went astray again . 
i mean , if they 'd have just taken that , taken peter dodson 's work , and gone on with that , then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have . 
but scientists have egos ; they like to name things . 
and so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different . 
now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur , or any animal , is a young one or an older one . 
and that 's by actually cutting into their bones . 
but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do , as you can imagine , because in museums bones are precious . 
you go into a museum and they take really good care of them . 
they put them in foam , little containers . 
they 're very well taken care of . 
they do n't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside . 
so they do n't normally let you do that . 
but i have a museum and i collect dinosaurs and i can saw mine open . 
so that 's what i do . 
so if you cut open a little dinosaur , it 's very spongy inside like a. 
and if you cut into an older dinosaur , it 's very massive . 
you can tell it 's mature bone . 
so it 's real easy to tell them apart . 
so what i want to do is show you these . 
in north america in the northern plains of the united states and the southern plains of alberta and saskatchewan , there 's this unit of rock called the hell creek formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on earth . 
and there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes -- i mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct . 
and so we will evaluate them . 
and that 's sort of what i 've been doing . 
so my students , my staff , we 've been cutting them open . 
now as you can imagine , cutting open a leg bone is one thing , but when you go to a museum and say , `` you do n't mind if i cut open your dinosaur 's skull do you ? '' 
they say , `` go away . '' 
so here are 12 dinosaurs . 
and we want to look at these three first . 
so these are dinosaurs that are called pachycephalosaurs . 
and everybody knows that these three animals are related . 
and the assumption is is that they 're related like cousins or whatever . 
but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related . 
in other words , people looked at them and they saw the differences . 
and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you 're related to your brother or your sister , you ca n't do it by looking at differences . 
you can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities . 
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are . 
pachycephalosaurus has a big , thick dome on its head , and it 's got some little bumps on the back of its head , and it 's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose . 
and then stygimoloch , another dinosaur from the same age , lived at the same time , has spikes sticking out the back of its head . 
it 's got a little , tiny dome , and it 's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose . 
and then there 's this thing called dracorex , hogwart 's eye . 
guess where that came from ? dragon . 
so here 's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head , no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose . 
nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike . 
but they did look at these three and they said , `` these are three different dinosaurs , and dracorex is probably the most primitive of them . 
and the other one is more primitive than the other . 
it 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out . 
but if you line them up , if you just take those three skulls and just line them up , they line up like this . 
dracorex is the littlest one , stygimoloch is the middle size one , pachycephalosaurus is the largest one . 
and one would think , that should give me a clue . 
but it did n't give them a clue . 
because , well we know why . 
scientists like to name things . 
so if we cut open dracorex -- i cut open our dracorex -- and look , it was spongy inside , really spongy inside . 
i mean , it is a juvenile and it 's growing really fast . 
so it is going to get bigger . 
if you cut open stygimoloch , it is doing the same thing . 
it 's inflating very fast . 
what 's interesting is the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well . 
the spikes on the back of the stygimoloch are actually resorbing , which means they 're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger . 
and if we look at pachycephalosaurus , pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing . 
so just with these three dinosaurs , you can easily -- as a scientist -- we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal . 
which of course means that stygimoloch and dracorex are extinct . 
okay . 
which of course means we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with . 
so a colleague of mine at berkley , he and i were looking at triceratops . 
and before the year 2000 -- now remember , triceratops was first found in the 1800s -- before 2000 , no one had ever seen a juvenile triceratops . 
there 's a triceratops in every museum in the world , but no one had ever collected a juvenile . 
and we know why , right ? 
because everybody wants to have a big one . 
so everyone had a big one . 
so we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones . 
they 're everywhere . they 're all over the place . 
so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum . 
and everybody says it 's because i have a little museum . 
when you have a little museum , you have little dinosaurs . 
if you look at the triceratops , you can see it 's changing , it 's shape-shifting . 
as the juveniles are growing up , their horns actually curve backwards . 
and then as they grow older , the horns grow forward . 
and that 's pretty cool . 
if you look along the edge of the frill , they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the pachycephalosaurs . 
and then , because the juveniles are in my collection , i cut them open and look inside . 
and the little one is really spongy . 
and the middle size one is really spongy . 
but what was interesting was the adult triceratops was also spongy . 
and this is a skull that is two meters long . 
it 's a big skull . 
but there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a triceratops , except it 's bigger , and it 's called torosaurus . 
and torosaurus , when we cut into it , has mature bone . 
and everybody says , `` a triceratops and a torosaurus ca n't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one . '' 
`` and it has holes in its frill . '' 
and i said , `` well do we have any juvenile torosauruses ? '' 
and they said , `` well no , but it has holes in its frill . '' 
so one of my graduate students , john scannella , looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in triceratops and , of course it 's open , in torosaurus -- so he found the transitional ones between triceratops and torosaurus , which was pretty cool . 
so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grownup triceratops . 
now when we name dinosaurs , when we name anything , the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out . 
so torosaurus is extinct . 
triceratops , if you 've heard the news , a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong . 
they thought torosaurus should be kept and triceratops thrown out , but that 's not going to happen . 
all right , so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs . 
i mean , here 's edmontosaurus and anatotitan . 
anatotitan : giant duck . 
it 's a giant duck-bill dinosaur . 
here 's another one . 
so we look at the bone histology . 
the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile , or at least a sub-adult , and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny . 
and we get rid of anatotitan . 
so we can just keep doing this . 
and the last one is t. rex . 
so there 's these two dinosaurs , t. rex and nanotyrannus . 
again , makes you wonder . 
but they had a good question . 
they were looking at them and they said , `` one 's got 17 teeth , and the biggest one 's got 12 teeth . 
so it must be true -- they must be different . '' 
so we cut into them . 
and sure enough , nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone . 
it looks like it could still get bigger . 
and at the museum of the rockies where we work , i have four t. rexes , so i can cut a whole bunch of them . 
but i did n't have to cut any of them really , because i just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14 . 
and of course , nano has 17 . 
and we just went out and looked at other people 's collections and we found one that has sort of 15 teeth . 
so again , real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus , and therefore we can take out another dinosaur . 
so when it comes down to our end cretaceous , we have seven left . 
and that 's a good number . 
that 's a good number to go extinct , i think . 
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with fourth-graders . 
fourth-graders love their dinosaurs , they memorize them . 
and they 're not happy with this . 
thank you very much . 
chris has been so nice . 
i do n't know how you keep it up , chris , i really do n't . 
so nice , all week . he 's the kind of man you could say to , `` chris , i 'm really sorry , i 've crashed your car . 
and it gets worse , i crashed it into your house . 
your house has caught fire . 
and what 's more , your wife has just run off with your best friend . '' 
and you know that chris would say , `` thank you . '' 
`` thank you for sharing , that 's really interesting . '' 
`` thank you for taking me to a place that i did n't know existed . thank you . '' 
one of the -- thank you for inviting us . 
one of the things about appearing later on in the ted week is that , gradually , as the days go by , all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say . 
nuclear fusion , i had about 10 minutes on that . 
spectroscopy , that was another one . 
parallel universes . 
and so this morning i thought , `` oh well , i 'll just do a card trick . '' 
that one 's gone as well . 
and today is emmanuel 's day , i think we 've agreed that , already , have n't we ? 
emmanuel ? absolutely . 
i was planning on finishing on a dance ... 
so , that 's going to look pretty shabby now . 
so , what i thought i 'd do is -- in honor of emmanuel -- is , what i can do is to launch today the first ted global auction . 
if i could start , this is the enigma decoding machine . 
who will start me with $ 1,000 ? anyone ? 
thank you . bruno 's face , just then , he said , `` no , do n't go through this . do n't , please do n't . 
do n't go through this . do n't do it . '' 
i 'm worried . when i first got the invitation , they said somewhere in the thing , they said , `` 15 minutes to change the world , your moment onstage . '' 15 minutes to change the world . 
i do n't know about you , it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug . 
so , the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one . 
well , of course now we know we do n't have to change a plug , now we 've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric -- fantastic . you know , it inspires us . 
300 years ago he 'd have been burnt at the stake for that . 
and now it 's an idea . 
it 's great . it 's fantastic . 
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way . 
yesterday , david deutsch , another one who covered most of what i was going to say . 
but when you think of the world in that way , it does make going to starbucks a whole new experience , do n't you think ? 
i mean , he must walk in and they will say , `` would you like a macchiato , or a latte , or an americano , or a cappuccino ? '' 
and he 'll say , `` you 're offering me things that are infinitely variable . '' 
`` how can your coffee be true ? '' 
and they will say , `` would you mind if i serve the next customer ? '' 
and elaine morgan yesterday , was n't she wonderful ? 
fantastic . really good . 
her talk about the aquatic ape , and the link , of course , the link between darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this -- we 're not hirsute and we can swim rather well . 
and she said , you know , she 's 90 . she 's running out of time , she said . 
and she 's desperate to find more evidence for the link . 
and i think , `` i 'm sitting next to lewis pugh . '' 
this man has swum around the north pole , what more evidence do you want ? 
and there he is . 
that 's how ted brings these connections together . 
i was n't here on tuesday . i did n't actually see gordon brown 's job application -- um , sorry . 
i 'm so sorry . 
i 'm so sorry . no , no. . 
: `` global problems require scottish solutions . '' 
the problem i have is because gordon brown , he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who 's just taken the head off a bear suit . 
: `` hello , can i tell you what happened in the woods back there ? 
uh , no. '' 
`` i 'm sorry . i 've only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions . 
our work on climate change , i 've only got 18 minutes , unfortunately i 'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we 're doing to promote the climate change agenda in great britain , like the third runway we 're planning at heathrow airport ... '' 
`` the large coal-fired power station we 're building at king 's north , and of course the exciting news that only today , only this week , britain 's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close . 
no time , unfortunately , to mention those . '' 
`` british jobs for scottish people ... 
no. '' 
`` christian principles , christian values . 
thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife . '' 
`` although to be honest , when i was at number 11 that was never going to be a problem . '' 
: `` yeah , alright , come on , eh . 
alright gordon , come on , eh . 
i just , can i just say a few things about , first about cherie , because she 's a wonderful lady , my wife , with a wonderful smile . 
that reminds me , i must post that letter . '' 
`` i just think , you know , what people forget , gordon and i , we always got on perfectly well . 
alright , it was never exactly ` brokeback mountain . ' '' `` you know , i wrote to him , just before i left office . i said , ` can i rely on your support for the next month ? ' and he wrote back . he said , ` no , you ca n't . ' which kind of surprised me , because i 'd never seen ` ca n't ' spelled that way before . '' 
another thing gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the mansion house in 2002 -- that was to the building ; the people were n't listening . 
but the people , when talking about the finance industry , he said , `` what you as the city of london have done for financial services , we , as a government , hope to do for the economy as a whole . '' 
when you think what 's happened to financial services , and you see what 's happened to the economy , you think , `` well , there is a man who delivers on his promises . '' 
but we 're in a new world now . we 're in a completely new world . 
this is the first time that i can remember , where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan , you do n't know if you 're borrowing money from him , or if he 's borrowing money from you . 
am i right ? 
these extraordinary things , icelandic internet accounts . 
did anyone here have an icelandic internet account ? 
why would you do that ? why would -- it 's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from nigeria , is n't it ? 
asking for your bank details . 
and , you know , iceland , it was never going to cut it . 
it did n't have that kind of collateral . 
what does it have ? it has fish , that 's all . 
that 's why the prime minister went on television . he said , `` this has left us all with a very big haddock . '' 
a lot of what i do -- i have to try and make sense of things before i can make nonsense of them . 
and making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult . 
luckily , somebody like george bush was really helpful . 
he summed it up , really , at a dinner . 
he was speaking at a dinner , he said , `` wall street got drunk . '' 
`` and now it 's got a hangover . '' 
and that 's , you know , that 's something -- and that 's something we can relate to . 
it 's certainly something he can relate to . 
and the other one , of course , is donald rumsfeld , who said , `` there are the known knowns , the things we know we know . 
and then you got the known unknowns , the things we know we do n't know . 
and then you got the unknown unknowns , those are the things we do n't know we do n't know . '' 
and being english , when i first heard that i thought , `` what a load of cock . '' 
and then , you 're now , well , actually , that 's what this is about . 
this whole , what ben bernanke has said , the chaotic unwinding of the world 's financial system , it 's about -- they do n't know , they did n't know what they were doing . 
in 2006 , the head of the american mortgage bankers association said , quote , `` as we can clearly see , no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the u.s. economy . '' 
now , there is a man on top of his job . 
and when the crisis was happening , the head of quantitative equities at lehman brothers said , `` events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days . '' 
so , it 's extraordinary . it 's a new world that 's very , very difficult to make sense of . 
but we have a new hope . we have a new man . 
america has now elected its first openly black president . 
wonderful news . 
not only that , he 's left-handed . have you noticed this ? 
you see , a lot of the people that i most admire , they 're great artists , great designers , great thinkers , they 're left-handed . 
and somebody said to me last night , you know , being left-handed , you have to learn to write without smudging the ink . 
and somebody was talking about metaphors on monday . 
and i thought , what a wonderful metaphor , is n't it ? an american president who has to write without smudging the ink . 
you like that one ? as opposed to you could see george bush , well , what 's the metaphor there ? 
i think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing , would n't it ? 
`` well , you know i 'm sorry about that . 
i 'm right-handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well . '' 
but , you know , he 's gone . now he 's gone . 
that 's eight years of american history , eight minutes of my act , just gone like that . 
`` you know , it 's the end of an error -lrb- sic -rrb- . 
i happen to believe it was a great error . 
i know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the united states . 
but we proved them wrong in iraq . 
they said there was no link between iraq and al qaeda . 
there is now . '' 
`` but i have a message for the suicide bombers , for those people who 've blown themselves up . '' 
`` we 're going to find you . '' 
`` we 're going to make sure you do n't do it again . '' 
but now he 's gone , and it 's great to see one of the -- arguably one of the worst speech makers in american history , now given way to one of the greatest , in obama . 
you were there , maybe , on the night of his victory . 
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , `` if there is anyone out there who still doubts that america is a place where all things are possible ... '' 
i ca n't do the whole thing because it would take too long , it really would . 
but you get the picture . and then it goes to the inauguration . 
and he and the chief justice , they trip over each other , they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up . 
and there is george bush sitting there going , `` heh heh heh heh ... '' 
`` not so easy is it ? heh heh heh . '' 
but the interesting thing is , gordon brown was talking about cicero , who said , people would listen to a speech , they said , `` great speech . '' 
and then they 'd listen to demosthenes , and they 'd say , `` let 's march . '' 
it 's rather like that line in the film `` as good as it gets . '' 
do you remember that film with helen hunt and jack nicholson , and helen hunt says to jack nicholson , `` what do you see in me ? '' 
and jack nicholson just says , `` you make me want to be a better man . '' 
and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen . right ? 
but at the moment , it 's a cicero thing . 
we like what barack obama says , but we do n't do anything about it . 
so he comes over to this country , and he says , `` we need a big fiscal stimulus . '' 
and everyone goes , `` great ! '' he leaves the country and the french and the germans go , `` no , no , forget about that , absolutely not . '' nothing happens . he goes to strasburg . 
he says , `` we need more boots on the ground in afghanistan . '' 
and everyone goes , `` great idea . '' 
he leaves , people go , `` no no no , we 're not going to do that . 
5,000 maximum , and no rockets . no , no , not going to do it . '' 
he goes to prague , he says , `` we believe in a nuclear-free world . '' 
and it 's great to have an american president who can say the word `` nuclear , '' let 's just point that out first . 
do you remember that ? george bush , `` a nu-ca-ler . '' 
sorry , what ? `` a nu-ca-ler . '' 
could you say `` avuncular '' ? `` avunclear . '' 
thank you very much . 
and that day , north korea , that very day , north korea is just seeing if it can just get one over japan -- -- and land it before ... 
so , where do we look for inspiration ? we 've still got bill clinton . 
`` i believe , i believe it was president dwight d. eisenhower who said ... '' 
`` tell a lie ; it was diana ross ... '' 
'' ... who said , reach out and touch ... '' 
'' ... somebody 's gla -- hand . '' 
`` make this world a better place , if you can . 
i just think that 's important . i really do . 
and i was hoping hillary would get to the white house , because she 'd have been out of our home for four years . 
and i , you know . '' 
`` so , when that did n't work out i had to make a few arrangements , let me tell you . '' 
so , there 's him . in britain we have prince charles : `` and the environment is so important , all we can do . 
my wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda . '' 
or , any south africans , we have mandela to inspire . 
mandela , the great man mandela . 
he 's been honored with a statue now . 
the previous highest honor he had in britain was a visit from the team from ground force , a gardening program . 
`` so , nelson , how would you like a nice water feature ? '' 
`` ahh , listen to me mr. titchmarsh . '' 
`` i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean . 
why would i need a bloody water feature ? '' 
very quickly : i was n't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the `` japanese essays on idleness '' which said it 's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth . 
thank you very much indeed . 
hi . i 'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise , admiration and thank you , and having it be specific and genuine . 
and the way i got interested in this was , i noticed in myself , when i was growing up , and until about a few years ago , that i would want to say thank you to someone , i would want to praise them , i would want to take in their praise of me and i 'd just stop it . 
and i asked myself , why ? 
i felt shy , i felt embarrassed . 
and then my question became , am i the only one who does this ? 
so , i decided to investigate . 
i 'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility , so i get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction . 
and sometimes it comes down to something as simple as , their core wound is their father died without ever saying he 's proud of them . 
but then , they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him , but he never told the son . 
it 's because he did n't know that his son needed to hear it . 
so my question is , why do n't we ask for the things that we need ? 
i know a gentleman , married for 25 years , who 's longing to hear his wife say , `` thank you for being the breadwinner , so i can stay home with the kids , '' but wo n't ask . 
i know a woman who 's good at this . 
she , once a week , meets with her husband and says , `` i 'd really like you to thank me for all these things i did in the house and with the kids . '' 
and he goes , `` oh , this is great , this is great . '' 
and praise really does have to be genuine , but she takes responsibility for that . 
and a friend of mine , april , who i 've had since kindergarten , she thanks her children for doing their chores . 
and she said , `` why would n't i thank it , even though they 're supposed to do it ? '' 
so , the question is , why was i blocking it ? 
why were other people blocking it ? 
why can i say , `` i 'll take my steak medium rare , i need size six shoes , '' but i wo n't say , `` would you praise me this way ? '' 
and it 's because i 'm giving you critical data about me . 
i 'm telling you where i 'm insecure . 
i 'm telling you where i need your help . 
and i 'm treating you , my inner circle , like you 're the enemy . 
because what can you do with that data ? 
you could neglect me . 
you could abuse it . 
or you could actually meet my need . 
and i took my bike into the bike store -- i love this -- same bike , and they 'd do something called `` truing '' the wheels . 
the guy said , `` you know , when you true the wheels , it 's going to make the bike so much better . '' 
i get the same bike back , and they 've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels i 've had for two and a half years , and my bike is like new . 
so , i 'm going to challenge all of you . 
i want you to true your wheels : be honest about the praise that you need to hear . 
what do you need to hear ? go home to your wife -- go ask her , what does she need ? 
go home to your husband -- what does he need ? 
go home and ask those questions , and then help the people around you . 
and it 's simple . 
and why should we care about this ? 
we talk about world peace . 
how can we have world peace with different cultures , different languages ? 
i think it starts household by household , under the same roof . 
so , let 's make it right in our own backyard . 
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons . 
and maybe somebody 's never said that to you , but you 've done a really , really good job . 
and thank you for being here , just showing up and changing the world with your ideas . 
thank you . 
some 17 years ago , i became allergic to delhi 's air . 
my doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent , and it was killing me . 
with the help of iit , teri , and learnings from nasa , we discovered that there are three basic green plants , common green plants , with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy . 
we 've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building , while maintaining industry indoor air-quality standards . 
the three plants are areca palm , mother-in-law 's tongue and money plant . 
the botanical names are in front of you . 
areca palm is a plant which removes co2 and converts it into oxygen . 
we had to grow them in vermi manure , which is sterile , or hydroponics , and take them outdoors every three to four months . 
the second plant is mother-in-law 's tongue , which is again a very common plant , and we call it a bedroom plant , because it converts co2 into oxygen at night . 
and we need six to eight waist-high plants per person . 
the third plant is money plant , and this is again a very common plant ; preferably grows in hydroponics . 
and this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals . 
with these three plants , you can grow all the fresh air you need . 
in fact , you could be in a bottle with a cap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any fresh air . 
we have tried these plants at our own building in delhi , which is a 50,000-square-feet , 20-year-old building . 
and it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants . 
our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one 's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours . 
the government of india has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in new delhi . 
and the study showed that , compared to other buildings , there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent , respiratory systems by 34 percent , headaches by 24 percent , lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent . 
and this study has been published on september 8 , 2008 , and it 's available on the government of india website . 
our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants . 
and also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent , because you need less fresh air . 
we are now replicating this in a 1.75-million-square-feet building , which will have 60,000 indoor plants . 
why is this important ? 
it is also important for the environment , because the world 's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade . 
40 percent of the world 's energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world 's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years . 
and there is a growing preference for living and working in air-conditioned places . 
`` be the change you want to see in the world , '' said mahatma gandhi . 
and thank you for listening . 
thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years . 
we 've questioned the future of capitalism . 
we 've questioned the financial industry . 
we 've looked at our government oversight . 
we 've questioned where we 're going . 
and yet , at the same time , this very well may be a seminal moment in american history , an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in america . 
i 'm calling this the great unwind . 
and the idea is a simple , simple idea , which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action . 
consumers who represent 72 percent of the gdp of america have actually started , just like banks and just like businesses , to de-leverage , to unwind their leverage , in daily life , to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward . 
so , to understand this -- and i 'm going to stress this -- it 's not about the consumer being in retreat . 
the consumer is empowered . 
in order to understand this , we 're going to step back and look a little bit at what 's happened over the course of the last year and a half . 
so , if you 've been gone , this is the easy cliffsnotes on what 's happened in the economy . okay ? 
unemployment up . housing values down . equity markets down . 
commodity prices are like this . 
if you 're a mom trying to manage a budget , and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer , and it 's somewhere between 50 and 70 , do you plan vacations ? how do you buy ? 
what is your strategy in your household ? 
will the bailout work ? we have national debt , detroit , currency valuations , healthcare , all these issues facing us . 
in fact , let 's go back and look at what caused this crisis , because the consumer , all of us , in our daily lives , actually contributed a large part to the problem . 
this is something i call the 50-20 paradox . 
it took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent . 50 years . 
do you know what this was right here ? 
this was world war ii . do you know why savings was so high ? 
there was nothing to buy , unless you wanted to buy some rivets . right ? 
so , what happened though , over the course of the last 20 years -- we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate . 
because we binged . we bought extra-large cars , supersized everything , we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome . 
all these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today . 
the personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 percent to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years . 
so consumers got overleveraged . 
and of course our banks did as well , as did our federal government . 
this is an absolutely staggering chart . 
it shows leverage , trended out from 1919 to 2009 . 
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education , future children in our households . 
so if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout , what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills , first of all , 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy . 
but if you stack it up , you just see this amazing , staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out . 
so this is the first 315 billion . 
but i read this fact the other day , that one trillion seconds equals 32 thousand years , so if you think about that , the context , the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here , and trillion there , we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage . 
however , consumers have moved . 
they are taking responsibility . 
what we 're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate . 
in fact , 11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis . 
we are working our way back up to that 10 percent . 
also , remarkably , in the fourth quarter , spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years , almost a 3.7 percent decline . 
visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they 're using credit cards . 
so we 're starting to pay for things with money that we have . 
and we 're starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest . 
but that 's not really the whole story . 
because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation . 
it 's been pretty staggering , what we 've lived through . 
if you take into account 80 percent of all americans were born after world war ii , this is essentially our depression . 
and so , as a result , some crazy things have happened . 
i 'll give you some examples . lets talk about dentists , vasectomies , guns and shark attacks . okay ? 
dentists report molars , you know , people grinding their teeth , coming in and reporting the fact that they 've had stress . 
and so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced . 
vasectomies are up 48 percent , according to the cornell institute . 
and lastly , but a very good point , hopefully not related to the former point i just made , which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003 . 
does anybody know why ? 
no one is at the beach . so there is a bright side to everything . 
but seriously , what we see happening , and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat , is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out . 
and what i mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption . right ? 
by restricting their demand , consumers can actually align their values with their spending , and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more , but be about better . 
we 're going to explain that right now . 
based on y&r 's brandasset valuator , proprietary tool of vml and young & rubicam , we set out to understand what 's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace . 
we found a couple of really interesting things . 
we 're going to go through four value-shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors , that offer new management principles . 
the first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life . 
this is the movement from americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity , because the less excess that you have around you , the more nimble and fleet of foot you are . 
as a result , déclassé consumption is in . 
déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion . 
the management principle is dollars and cents . 
so let 's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption that falls out of this value . 
first things is we see something must be happening when p. diddy vows to tone down his bling . 
but seriously , we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places , where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary , sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases . 
we see high-end haggling in fashion today . 
high-end haggling for luxury and real estate . 
we also see just a relaxing of ego , and sort of a dismantling of artifice . 
this is a story on the yacht club that 's all basically blue collar . 
blue-collar yacht club , where you can join the yacht club , but you 've got to work in the boat yard , as sort of condition of membership . 
we also see the trend toward tourism that 's a little bit more low key . right ? 
agritourism , going to vineyards and going to farms . 
and then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents . 
what businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting . 
a couple things that are kind of cool . 
one is that frito-lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer . 
they found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month , less at the end of the month . so what they did is they started to change their packaging . 
larger packs at the beginning of the month , smaller packaging at the end of the month . 
really interestingly , too , was the san francisco giants . 
they 've just instituted dynamic pricing . 
so it takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups , to the weather , to the team records , in setting prices for the consumer . 
another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of zynga . 
zynga has risen on the consumer 's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed-cost . 
again , this theme is about variable cost , variable living . 
so micropayments have become huge . 
and lastly , some people are using hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill . 
so , really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand . 
the second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play . 
we see that play itself out with empathy and respect . 
the consumer is demanding it . 
and , as a result , businesses must provide not only value , but values . 
increasingly , consumers are looking at the culture of the company , looking for their conduct in the marketplace . 
so , what we see with empathy and respect , lots of really hopeful things that have come out of this recession . 
and i 'll give you a few examples . 
one is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods , and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system . 
also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing , which has been unemployment , is a rise in volunteerism that 's been noted in our country . 
we also see the phenomenon -- some of you may have `` boomerang kids '' -- these are `` boomerang alumni , '' where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs , sharing skills and retraining . 
we also talked about character and professionalism . 
we had this miracle on the hudson in new york city , you know , in january , and suddenly sully has become a key name on babycenter . 
so , from a value and values standpoint , what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways . 
microsoft is doing something wonderful . 
they are actually vowing to retrain two million americans with i.t. training , using their existing infrastructure to do something good . 
also a really interesting company is gore-tex . 
gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees , to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses . 
but they also talk about the fact that their executives , all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see . 
complete transparency . 
think twice before you have that bottle of wine . 
the third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living . 
we 're seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon , not a sprint . 
they are digging in . and they 're looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase that they make . 
witness the fact that americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before , 9.4 years on average , in march . a record . 
we also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for america . 
did you know that 68 percent of americans now carry a library card ? 
the highest percentage ever in our nation 's history . 
so what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge . 
continuing education is up . 
everything is focused on betterment , and training , and development and moving forward . 
we also see a big diy movement . 
i was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners . 
that includes cottages and the like . but 30 percent . 
so , people are getting their hands dirty . they are rolling up their sleeves . 
they want these skills . 
and then we look at the high line in new york city , an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good , which is a brand new park in new york city . 
so , what brands can do , and companies , is pay dividends to consumers , be a brand that lasts , offer transparency , promise you 're going to be there beyond today 's sale . 
perfect example of that is patagonia . 
patagonia 's footprint chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make , and gives you social responsibility , and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make . 
another great example is fidelity . 
rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases , this is about 529 rewards for your student education . 
or the interesting company sunrun . 
i love this company . they 've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility , where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace . 
so , it 's a consumer driven co-op . 
so , the fourth sort of post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold . 
it 's incredibly important right now . 
trust is not parceled out , as we all know . 
it 's now about connecting to your communities , connecting to your social networks . 
in my book i talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company , versus 15 percent on advertising . 
so , in that respect , cooperative consumerism has really taken off . 
this is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace . 
let 's look at a couple of quick examples . 
the artisanal movement is huge . 
everything about locally derived products and services , supporting your local neighborhoods , whether it 's cheeses , wines and other products . 
also this rise of local currencies . 
realizing that it 's difficult to get loans in this environment , you 're doing business with people you trust , in your local markets . 
so , this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon . 
and then they did a recent report i thought was fascinating . 
they actually started , in certain communities in the united states , start to publish people 's electricity usage . 
and what they found out is when that was available for public record , the people 's electricity usage in those communities dropped . 
then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling , which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled . 
and then there is this other really interesting movement that 's happened in california , which is about carrot mobs . 
the traditional thing would be to boycott right ? 
have a stick ? well why not have a carrot ? 
and then we look at what companies can do . 
this is all the opportunity about being a community organizer . 
you have to realize that you ca n't fight and control this . 
you actually need to organize it . 
you need to harness it . you need to give it meaning . 
and there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see . 
first is just the rise of the fact that zagat 's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants , into actually rating healthcare . 
so what credentials does zagat 's have ? 
well , they have a lot , because it 's their network of people . right ? 
then you look at the phenomenon of kogi . 
this kogi does n't exist . it 's a moving truck . right ? 
it 's a moving truck through l.a. , and the only way you can find it is through twitter . 
or you look at johnson & johnson 's momversations . 
a phenomenal blog that 's been built up . 
where j&j basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers , allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect . 
and it 's also become a very , very valuable sort of advertising revenue for j&j as well . 
this plus the fact that you 've got phenomenal work from ceos from ford to zappos , connecting on twitter , creating an open environment , allowing their employees to be part of the process , rather than hidden behind walls . 
you see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt , all because the consumer is demanding it . 
so , when we look at this and we step back , what i believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real . 
it 's been tremendously powerful for consumers . 
but , at the same time , this is also a tremendous opportunity . 
and the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin . 
crisis equals opportunity . 
what we 're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession . 
so , we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better . 
it will drive innovation . 
it will make longer-lasting products . it will create better , more intuitive customer service . 
it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share . 
so , when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we 're seeing in our data , we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america . 
thank you very much . 
i 'm a storyteller . 
that 's what i do in life -- telling stories , writing novels -- and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni . 
but before i go there , please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story . 
i will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geometrical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles . 
i was born in strasbourg , france to turkish parents . 
shortly after , my parents got separated , and i came to turkey with my mom . 
from then on , i was raised as a single child by a single mother . 
now in the early 1970s , in ankara , that was a bit unusual . 
our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of households , so i grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment . 
in fact , i grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood . 
on the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , turkish woman . 
on the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational . 
this was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye . 
many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands . 
each time , my grandmother would utter some words in arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove . 
then one by one , she would encircle these thorns with dark ink . 
a week later , the patient would come back for a follow-up examination . 
now , i 'm aware that i should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , i did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed . 
i asked her how she did this . was it the power of praying ? 
in response she said , `` yes , praying is effective , but also beware of the power of circles . '' 
from her , i learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson -- that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an acne , a blemish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls . 
it will dry up inside . 
now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle . 
we 're born into a certain family , nation , class . 
but if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of drying up inside . 
our imagination might shrink ; our hearts might dwindle , and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons . 
our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family -- if all the people in our inner circle resemble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image . 
now one other thing women like my grandma do in turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out . 
it 's an old eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it 's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection . 
ironically , -lrb- living in -rrb- communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today 's globalized world . 
and it 's happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , east and west alike . 
we tend to form clusters based on similarity , and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people . 
in my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling . 
stories can not demolish frontiers , but they can punch holes in our mental walls . 
and through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see . 
i started writing fiction at the age of eight . 
my mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if i 'd be interested in keeping a personal journal . 
in retrospect , i think she was slightly worried about my sanity . 
i was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except i told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good . 
i was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when i bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions . 
what she did n't know was that i thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing i wanted to do was to write about myself . 
instead , i began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened . 
and thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction . 
so from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives , other possibilities . 
and please bear with me : i 'll draw a circle and come back to this point . 
now one other thing happened around this same time . 
my mother became a diplomat . 
so from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , i was zoomed into this posh , international school -lrb- in madrid -rrb- , where i was the only turk . 
it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the `` representative foreigner . '' 
in our classroom , there were children from all nationalities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan , egalitarian classroom democracy . 
instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own , but as the representative of something larger . 
we were like a miniature united nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regards to a nation or a religion , took place . 
the child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly . 
and i should know , because during the time i attended that school , a military takeover happened in my country , a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope , and turkey got zero points in -lrb- the -rrb- eurovision song contest . 
i skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days . 
i also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there . 
the other children asked me about the movie `` midnight express , '' which i had not seen ; they inquired how many cigarettes a day i smoked , because they thought all turks were heavy smokers , and they wondered at what age i would start covering my hair . 
i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil . 
after spain , we went to jordan , germany and ankara again . 
everywhere i went , i felt like my imagination was the only suitcase i could take with me . 
stories gave me a sense of center , continuity and coherence , the three big cs that i otherwise lacked . 
in my mid-twenties , i moved to istanbul , the city i adore . 
i lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels . 
when i ran out of the building at three in the morning , i saw something that stopped me in my tracks . 
there was the local grocer there -- a grumpy , old man who did n't sell alcohol and did n't speak to marginals . 
he was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks . 
i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today -- a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk . 
in the face of death and destruction , our mundane differences evaporated , and we all became one even if for a few hours . 
but i 've always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us . 
i 'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , cozy apartments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against . 
shortly after , i went to a women 's college in boston , then michigan . 
i experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one . 
i started writing fiction in english . 
i 'm not an immigrant , refugee or exile -- they ask me why i do this -- but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself . 
i love writing in turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and i love writing in english , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral . 
so i feel connected to each language in a different way . 
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an acquired language . 
when you 're a latecomer to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpetual frustration . 
as latecomers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jokes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there 's a gap between the mind and the tongue . 
and that gap is very intimidating . 
but if we manage not to be frightened by it , it 's also stimulating . 
and this is what i discovered in boston -- that frustration was very stimulating . 
at this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that i urgently get married so that i could settle down once and for all . 
and because god loves her , i did get married . 
but instead of settling down , i went to arizona . 
and since my husband is in istanbul , i started commuting between arizona and istanbul -- the two places on the surface of earth that could n't be more different . 
i guess one part of me has always been a nomad , physically and spiritually . 
stories accompany me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existential glue . 
yet as much as i love stories , recently , i 've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story . 
and this is a subject that i would love to think about together . 
when my first novel written in english came out in america , i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic . 
`` i liked your book , '' he said , `` but i wish you had written it differently . '' 
i asked him what he meant by that . 
he said , `` well , look at it . there 's so many spanish , american , hispanic characters in it , but there 's only one turkish character and it 's a man . '' 
now the novel took place on a university campus in boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than turkish characters , but i understood what my critic was looking for . 
and i also understood that i would keep disappointing him . 
he wanted to see the manifestation of my identity . 
he was looking for a turkish woman in the book because i happened to be one . 
we often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed . 
many authors feel this pressure , but non-western authors feel it more heavily . 
if you 're a woman writer from the muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy muslim women . 
you 're expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your western colleagues . 
what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today . 
we 're all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar . 
the writer and commuter james baldwin gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality . 
when the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer , baldwin stopped and said , `` but do n't you see ? there 's nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . '' 
when identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger . 
there 's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the western world are lumped together . 
i never forget my first multicultural reading , in harvard square about 10 years ago . 
we were three writers , one from the philippines , one turkish and one indonesian -- like a joke , you know . 
and the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste . 
it was only because of our passports . 
multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imaginary . 
a function is attributed to fiction . 
in this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger . 
but i must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not solely come from the west . 
it comes from everywhere . 
and i experienced this firsthand when i was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel . 
i had intended to write a constructive , multi-layered novel about an armenian and a turkish family through the eyes of women . 
my micro story became a macro issue when i was prosecuted . 
some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the turkish-armenian conflict . 
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction . 
it was just a story . 
and when i say , `` just a story , '' i 'm not trying to belittle my work . 
i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end . 
writers are entitled to their political opinions , and there are good political novels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics . 
chekhov said , `` the solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things . 
and only the latter is an artist 's responsibility . '' 
identity politics divides us . fiction connects . 
one is interested in sweeping generalizations . 
the other , in nuances . 
one draws boundaries . 
the other recognizes no frontiers . 
identity politics is made of solid bricks . 
fiction is flowing water . 
in the ottoman times , there were itinerant storytellers called `` meddah . '' 
they would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvising . 
with each new person in the story , the meddah would change his voice , impersonating that character . 
everybody could go and listen , you know -- ordinary people , even the sultan , muslims and non-muslims . 
stories cut across all boundaries , like `` the tales of nasreddin hodja , '' which were very popular throughout the middle east , north africa , the balkans and asia . 
today , stories continue to transcend borders . 
when palestinian and israeli politicians talk , they usually do n't listen to each other , but a palestinian reader still reads a novel by a jewish author , and vice versa , connecting and empathizing with the narrator . 
literature has to take us beyond . 
if it can not take us there , it is not good literature . 
books have saved the introverted , timid child that i was -- that i once was . 
but i 'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them . 
when the poet and mystic , rumi , met his spiritual companion , shams of tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss rumi 's books into water and watch the letters dissolve . 
the sufis say , `` knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . '' 
the problem with today 's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge -- we know a lot about each other , or so we think -- but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us elitist , distant and disconnected . 
there 's a metaphor which i love : living like a drawing compass . 
as you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place . 
meanwhile , the other leg draws a wide circle , constantly moving . 
like that , my fiction as well . 
one part of it is rooted in istanbul , with strong turkish roots , but the other part travels the world , connecting to different cultures . 
in that sense , i like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere . 
now those of you who have been to istanbul have probably seen topkapi palace , which was the residence of ottoman sultans for more than 400 years . 
in the palace , just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines , there 's an area called the gathering place of the djinn . 
it 's between buildings . 
i 'm intrigued by this concept . 
we usually distrust those areas that fall in between things . 
we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn , who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness . 
but my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most . 
when i write fiction i cherish elusiveness and changeability . 
i like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later . 
i like it when my characters surprise me . 
i might write about a muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a handsome , gay professor in norway . 
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything . 
audre lorde once said , `` the white fathers taught us to say , ' i think , therefore i am . ' '' she suggested , `` i feel , therefore i am free . '' 
i think it was a wonderful paradigm shift . 
and yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is `` write what you know '' ? 
perhaps that 's not the right way to start at all . 
we should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel . 
we should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next . 
in the end , stories move like whirling dervishes , drawing circles beyond circles . 
they connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news . 
and i would like to finish with an old sufi poem : `` come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . '' 
thank you . 
we live in difficult and challenging economic times , of course . 
and one of the first victims of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curiosity-led science and exploration . 
so i want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that 's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do . 
but i think to set the scene , i want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted , but it is a bit of a mess . 
but actually , it 's not my fault ; it 's from the guardian newspaper . 
and it 's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs . 
because , if i 'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration , i should tell you how much it costs . 
so this is a game called `` spot the science budgets . '' 
this is the u.k. government spend . 
the science budget is actually -- if you look to your left , there 's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs . 
and it 's one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob . 
it 's about 3.3 billion pounds per year out of 620 billion . 
that funds everything in the u.k. 
from medical research , space exploration , where i work , at cern in geneva , particle physics , engineering , even arts and humanities , funded from the science budget , which is that 3.3 billion , that little , tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen . 
so that 's what we 're arguing about . 
that percentage , by the way , is about the same in the u.s. and germany and france . 
r&d in total in the economy , publicly funded , is about 0.6 percent of gdp . 
so that 's what we 're arguing about . 
the first thing i want to say , and this is straight from `` wonders of the solar system , '' is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful . 
this is a picture that actually was sent back by the cassini space probe around saturn , after we 'd finished filming `` wonders of the solar system . '' 
so it is n't in the series . 
it 's of the moon enceladus . 
so that big sweeping , white sphere in the corner is saturn , which is actually in the background of the picture . 
and that crescent there is the moon enceladus , which is about as big as the british isles . 
it 's about 500 kilometers in diameter . 
so , tiny moon . 
what 's fascinating and beautiful ... 
what 's beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some faint , sort of , wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb . 
this is how we visualize that in `` wonders of the solar system . '' 
it 's a beautiful graphic . 
what we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon . 
that 's fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon . 
and what 's important about that is that , on our planet , on earth , wherever we find liquid water , we find life . 
so , to find strong evidence of liquid , pools of liquid , beneath the surface of a moon 750 million miles away from the earth is really quite astounding . 
so what we 're saying , essentially , is maybe that 's a habitat for life in the solar system . 
well , let me just say , that was a graphic . i just want to show this picture . 
that 's one more picture of enceladus . 
this is when cassini flew beneath enceladus . 
so it made a very low pass , just a few hundred kilometers above the surface . 
and so this , again , a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space , absolutely beautiful . 
but that 's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system . 
that 's probably this place , which is a moon of jupiter , europa . 
and again , we had to fly to the jovian system to get any sense that this moon , as most moons , was anything other than a dead ball of rock . 
it 's actually an ice moon . 
so what you 're looking at is the surface of the moon europa , which is a thick sheet of ice , probably a hundred kilometers thick . 
but by measuring the way that europa interacts with the magnetic field of jupiter , and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around , we 've inferred very strongly that there 's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of europa . 
so below the ice , there 's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon . 
we think it 's saltwater , and that would mean that there 's more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined . 
so that place , a little moon around jupiter , is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the earth , that we know of . 
tremendous and beautiful discovery . 
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful . 
it may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask , which is : `` are we alone in the universe ? '' 
is there any other use to exploration and science , other than just a sense of wonder ? 
well , there is . 
this is a very famous picture taken , actually , on my first christmas eve , december 24th , 1968 , when i was about eight months old . 
it was taken by apollo 8 as it went around the back of the moon . 
earthrise from apollo 8 . 
a famous picture ; many people have said that it 's the picture that saved 1968 , which was a turbulent year -- the student riots in paris , the height of the vietnam war . 
the reason many people think that about this picture , and al gore has said it many times , actually , on the stage at ted , is that this picture , arguably , was the beginning of the environmental movement . 
because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a solid , immovable , kind of indestructible place , but as a very small , fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space . 
what 's also not often said about the space exploration , about the apollo program , is the economic contribution it made . 
i mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this , it cost a lot , did n't it ? 
well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness , the economic impact of apollo . 
the biggest one was in 1975 by chase econometrics . 
and it showed that for every $ 1 spent on apollo , 14 came back into the u.s. economy . 
so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , i think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over . 
so exploration can pay for itself . 
what about scientific discovery ? 
what about driving innovation ? 
well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing . 
what it is , is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen . 
see , back in the 1880s , 1890s , many scientists , many observers , looked at the light given off from atoms . 
and they saw strange pictures like this . 
what you 're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it does n't just glow like a white light , it just emits light at particular colors , a red one , a light blue one , some dark blue ones . 
now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that 's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them . 
and the electrons can only be in particular places . 
and when they jump up to the next place they can be , and fall back down again , they emit light at particular colors . 
and so the fact that atoms , when you heat them up , only emit light at very specific colors , was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms . 
i just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable . 
this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the sun . 
and now , this is a picture of atoms in the sun 's atmosphere absorbing light . 
and again , they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down , jump up and fall down . 
but look at the number of black lines in that spectrum . 
and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element . 
and that 's why helium 's called helium . 
it 's called `` helios '' -- helios from the sun . 
now , that sounds esoteric , and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon , for example . 
the way that silicon behaves , the fact that you can build transistors , is a purely quantum phenomenon . 
so without that curiosity-driven understanding of the structure of atoms , which led to this rather esoteric theory , quantum mechanics , then we would n't have transistors , we would n't have silicon chips , we would n't have pretty much the basis of our modern economy . 
there 's one more , i think , wonderful twist to that tale . 
in `` wonders of the solar system , '' we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal . 
it 's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on earth , is you can transport it , not only to the planets , but to the most distant stars and galaxies . 
and one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transistors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.4 times the mass of the sun . 
that 's a limit imposed on the mass of stars . 
you can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory , get a telescope , swing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the sun . 
that 's quite an incredible prediction . 
what happens when you have a star that 's right on the edge of that mass ? 
well , this is a picture of it . 
this is the picture of a galaxy , a common `` our garden '' galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our sun in it . 
it 's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe . 
there are a billion stars in the galactic core , which is why it 's shining out so brightly . 
this is about 50 million light years away , so one of our neighboring galaxies . 
but that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy . 
so that star is also 50 million light years away . 
it 's part of that galaxy , and it 's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it . 
that 's a type ia supernova explosion . 
now that 's an incredible phenomena , because it 's a star that sits there . 
it 's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf . 
it sits there about , say , 1.3 times the mass of the sun . 
and it has a binary companion that goes around it , so a big star , a big ball of gas . 
and what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star , until it gets to this limit called the chandrasekhar limit , and then it explodes . 
and it explodes , and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks , and releases , not only energy , but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe . 
now , there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the big bang . 
and there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars . 
it was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us . 
i think that 's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth . 
this is a beautiful quote that i found -- we 're talking about serendipity there -- from alexander fleming : `` when i woke up just after dawn on september 28 , 1928 , i certainly did n't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world 's first antibiotic . '' 
now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor . 
and they certainly did n't intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions , which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe . 
it can also , i think , finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet . 
this is a spectacular picture of our home planet . 
now , it does n't look like our home planet . 
it looks like saturn because , of course , it is . 
it was taken by the cassini space probe . 
but it 's a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of saturn 's rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings . 
and if i blow it up there , you see it . 
it looks like a moon , but in fact , it 's a picture of earth . 
it was a picture of earth captured in that frame of saturn . 
that 's our planet from 750 million miles away . 
i think the earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems . 
but that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet . 
it was taken by this thing , which is called the voyager spacecraft . 
and that 's a picture of me in front of it for scale . 
the voyager is a tiny machine . 
it 's currently 10 billion miles away from earth , transmitting with that dish , with the power of 20 watts , and we 're still in contact with it . 
but it visited jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune . 
and after it visited all four of those planets , carl sagan , who 's one of my great heroes , had the wonderful idea of turning voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited . 
and it took this picture of earth . 
now it 's very hard to see the earth there , it 's called the `` pale blue dot '' picture , but earth is suspended in that red shaft of light . 
that 's earth from four billion miles away . 
and i 'd like to read you what sagan wrote about it , just to finish , because i can not say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken . 
he said , `` consider again that dot . 
that 's here . that 's home . that 's us . 
the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there , on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam . 
it 's been said that astronomy 's a humbling and character-building experience . 
there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world . 
to me , it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot , the only home we 've ever known . '' 
beautiful words about the power of science and exploration . 
the argument has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe . 
you could have made it in the 1920s ; you would n't have had penicillin . 
you could have made it in the 1890s ; you would n't have the transistor . 
and it 's made today in these difficult economic times . 
surely , we know enough . 
we do n't need to discover anything else about our universe . 
let me leave the last words to someone who 's rapidly becoming a hero of mine , humphrey davy , who did his science at the turn of the 19th century . 
he was clearly under assault all the time . 
`` we know enough at the turn of the 19th century . 
just exploit it ; just build things . '' 
he said this , he said , `` nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate , that our triumphs are complete , that there are no mysteries in nature , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . '' 
thank you . 
so , imagine you 're standing on a street anywhere in america and a japanese man comes up to you and says , `` excuse me , what is the name of this block ? '' 
and you say , `` i 'm sorry , well , this is oak street , that 's elm street . 
this is 26th , that 's 27th . '' 
he says , `` ok , but what is the name of that block ? '' 
you say , `` well , blocks do n't have names . 
streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . '' 
he leaves , a little confused and disappointed . 
so , now imagine you 're standing on a street , anywhere in japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , `` excuse me , what is the name of this street ? '' 
they say , `` oh , well that 's block 17 and this is block 16 . '' 
and you say , `` ok , but what is the name of this street ? '' 
and they say , `` well , streets do n't have names . 
blocks have names . 
all of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks . 
and you say then , `` ok , then how do you know your home address ? '' 
he said , `` well , easy , this is district eight . 
there 's block 17 , house number one . '' 
you say , `` ok , but walking around the neighborhood , i noticed that the house numbers do n't go in order . '' 
he says , `` of course they do . they go in the order in which they were built . 
the first house ever built on a block is house number one . 
the second house ever built is house number two . 
third is house number three . it 's easy . it 's obvious . '' 
so , i love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we did n't even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true . 
so , for example , there are doctors in china who believe that it 's their job to keep you healthy . 
so , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you 're sick you do n't have to pay them because they failed at their job . they get rich when you 're healthy , not sick . 
in most music , we think of the `` one '' as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four . 
but in west african music , the `` one '' is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence . 
so , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one . 
and this map is also accurate . 
there 's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about india , the opposite is also true . 
so , let 's never forget , whether at ted , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true . 
domo arigato gozaimashita . 
pat mitchell : what is the story of this pin ? 
madeleine albright : this is `` breaking the glass ceiling . '' 
pm : oh . 
that was well chosen , i would say , for tedwomen . 
ma : most of the time i spend when i get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen . 
and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it had n't been for saddam hussein . 
i 'll tell you what happened . 
i went to the united nations as an ambassador , and it was after the gulf war , and i was an instructed ambassador . 
and the cease-fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions , and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about saddam hussein constantly , which he deserved -- he had invaded another country . 
and so all of a sudden , a poem appeared in the papers in baghdad comparing me to many things , but among them an `` unparalleled serpent . ''
