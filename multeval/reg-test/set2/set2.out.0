i think that nature is dominated by law , and we , of course , it 's not that it would be good them at any particular time understand , but we try . and trying to get all closer to understanding .
and in the end , it was starting to all the time a мучить thought is that when we die , our own lives speaking of праха in collapse .
and their solid beliefs about it in plain language , метафорами and притчами .
well , if i did n't fully to reveal the book , if i приоткрою it by 90 degrees , we 're going to look at the pantheon as though at the top , and then we look like from somewhere up , down , in the area .
it looks like a typical place in the universe ?
one physical system -- our brains are contains the model in the system -- квазара .
interestingly changes hope .
actually , all the packaging .
we really want to get it to you on how to communicate with федеральными , окружными and local authorities organs to get them to do something .
in that city has a тайваньская firm , which makes an iphone , that there 's probably a lot of you , and makes them with the help of labor chinese who перебрались in called shenzhen .
so he went by , and for the surgery .
so meat multiplied in five times .
in fact , there 's no on the earth food , which is the requirements of the питательным веществам , and yet do n't want to grow enough , and a lot of them are much полезнее for health than what we eat today .
i was the prison -- it 's hard .
mk : we 've got to deal about the brand .
we can do it !
it turns out , there 's a model , which has
we 're at them not for them , but for ourselves .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play now this problem i had cracked бессовестно have виолончелистов .
so please forgive me .
whether it 's asking me to raise your hand or поаплодировать people of various ages ?
i wonder how many people here from three to 12 years old .
that is , not a single ?
all right .
i 'm going to tell you about dinosaurs .
do you remember the dinosaurs your childhood ?
the dinosaurs , they do прикольные .
but now we 're going to talk about a different .
so i 'm just going to give you the rest of my idea : can i ask you do n't вымирать .
that 's all it is .
i 'm often asked , and this is the most frequent задаваемый question : why do children were like dinosaurs ?
well , what their fascination ?
and i would always say , `` well , the dinosaurs were big , which , and they went extinct . ''
they are gone .
but that 's not true , but for a minute 'll act as though we do and it worked .
well , the basic idea is this : big , generous and вымершие .
the title of my talk is : begin the form of dinosaurs : reasons преждевременного extinction .
i think that we remember dinosaurs .
there are lots of different forms .
a lot of different types .
a very long time ago , in 1900-е , it was to find dinosaurs .
they gather them .
and the interesting thing is that every museum
wanted a dinosaur bigger and better than others .
and if the museum in a toronto заполучил тираннозавра , big , the museum in the оттаве wanted to kind of the same , but more and more .
and it happened with all these museums .
everyone was looking to бо́льших and the dinosaurs .
it was in the early 1900s .
take a look at all of these dinosaurs .
they all big .
where are all these little dinosaurs ? ''
they were thinking about it and even have written about this talk , `` where is the little dinosaurs ? ''
well , if you go to the museum , you 'll see , there 's a lot there pups dinosaurs .
people have -- this is the problem was -- people assumed that if they had the children dinosaurs , if they had a динозавры-подростки , it would be easy to identify .
but all they had was -- it 's a big dinosaurs .
and this leads us to two замечаниям :
so , first of all , have scientists have egos , and besides , they like to the names of 've classified it that way .
they at all like to чему-нибудь names .
anybody like that , when of any animal has his name .
and whenever they were something that looked like a few differently , and they called it in a different way .
in 1975 , просветление снизошло on a someone 's head .
dr. peter додсон at the university of пенсильванском recognized that the dinosaurs were just like the birds , the different than what grow reptiles .
in fact , he used as an example казуара .
now think about that .
in fact , they put their юношеские characteristics very for a long time in what we call онтогенезом .
so , аллометрический онтогенез черепной box has a correlation with its size skull .
and that 's the problem , and peter додсон looked at this focus , looking at уткоклювых dinosaurs , which is called the гипакрозаврами .
he showed that if you take детёныша and an adult abalone and imagine what it should look like the average age of between them if they kept growing linearly , so he had to be a гребень , equal to half the size of the ridge grown-up species .
but , in fact , a young неполовозрелые species at 65 percent of the time does n't have the ridge .
it was interesting .
and that was that it , again завело people gridlock .
if they did it , did a study додсона and agreed , we would have been much less species of dinosaurs than we have .
but because the scientists have their own egos , and they like to all sorts of things .
and they were name dinosaurs , because they were different .
but now we have a way to see if there was a dinosaur or more of any animal , a young and old особью .
you know , разрезав bone .
but you cut a bone dinosaurs -- pretty hard , as you can imagine , because for museums bone is the true jewelry .
you go to a museum and see what they really care about them .
they put them in a styrofoam , a little containers .
they carefully ухаживают for them .
and they do n't like it , if you want to go and saw them and look inside .
and typically , they do n't разрешают to do it .
but i have a museum , and i коллекционирую dinosaurs , and i can saw their specimens .
and i 'm этим-то .
if you вскроете bone детёныша dinosaur , they will be a губчатыми , as well .
and if you вскроете dinosaur bones are older , it 's very массивным .
you can just say , that 's a зрелая bone .
it 's very easy to spot .
well , i 'm going to show you this .
in north america , in the northern равнинах of the united states , and in a southern равнинах альберты and саскачевана mountain of formed a формацию хелл-крик , where the last dinosaurs lived on earth .
and the 12 of them , is that can learn , every -- i mean , the 12th of the dinosaurs that went extinct .
and we take them .
this is one of the things that i 've been doing .
my students , my team вскрывали them .
as you can imagine , вскрытие bone legs -- this is one thing , but when you go to a museum and you say , `` would you mind if i вскрою skull your dinosaur , and ? ''
they say , `` убирайтесь ! ''
here 12 dinosaurs .
the way we look at the first three .
this is the dinosaurs , which is called the пахицефалозаврами .
and we all know these three is related .
it 's supposed to be the them -- двоюродному or something like that .
but no one suggests that they can do that in a близком родстве .
in other words , people take a look at them and see the difference .
and you all know , which , if you want to determine whether you 're a being a brother or sister , you ca n't see it , if we look at the difference .
you 're going to be able to figure -- , just поискав similarities .
so people would look at them and say , what they are .
there was a big пахицефалозавров куполообразный set on the skull , little protuberances in the back of your head and шипы at the end of the nose .
now , here is another стигимолох is exactly the same age , живший at the same time , in the back of his head торчали sharp шипы .
he had a very small черепной set and шипы on the nose .
and this is a дракорекс , хогвартса eye .
know this ? how do dragon .
this is a dinosaur , which has a head were шипы , but there was no куполообразного rule book , and the nose торчали шипы .
and nobody noticed that the шипы were converge .
but they were looking at these three of them and say , `` these are the three different dinosaurs , and probably a дракорекс -- the most primitive little out of them .
and then the more primitive little than the other .
and i 'm confused , how they 're so классифицировали them .
but if you create them in the line , if you create a line three of these skull , this to be true .
дракорекс -- the smallest , стигимолох -- the middle size , пахицефалозавр -- the largest .
and who would have thought that this is going to be a clue .
but it was n't a clue to the rest of us .
and we know why .
scientists like getting the names of anything .
so if we вскроем дракорекса -- i вскрыл our дракорекса -- and it turned out , inside it a губчатый , completely губчатый .
and so , this is a young one , you can see that , and it 's very rapidly growing .
it will become more .
if you вскроете стигимолоха , here is the same thing .
it 's a very quickly .
and what 's interesting is a шипы on the back of the дракорекса also grew up very quickly .
шипы on the back of the стигимолоха gone , so they started getting smaller , as a dome bigger .
if we look at пахицефалозавра , he had a solid dome , a little шишки in the back of your head disappeared .
for example , these three dinosaurs , you can easily -- as scientists -- we can easily assume that it 's just a bunch of different individuals of the age of the same animal .
which , of course , means that стигимолохи and the дракорексы went extinct .
all right .
that means that we have to deal with the skyline of 10 dinosaurs .
well , one of my colleagues at berkeley , and i looked at it , трицератопса .
and all the way up to 2000 , but consider , for the first time трицератопсы were discovered in the 1800s , to 2000 , no one has ever seen a young трицератопса .
now there 's a трицератопс in every museum of the world , but nobody 's ever had an abalone again .
and we know why , right ?
because everybody wants a dinosaur more of them .
so they all have big dinosaurs .
well , we tried to take that dinosaurs , and we found lots and lots of little dinosaurs .
they 're all over the place , they everywhere .
including in a museum .
they 're talking , it 's because the museum small .
if you have a little museum , it 's a little dinosaurs .
if you look at the трицератопса , you can see how it actually does , like changes its shape .
as modern humans have been around them , horns grew back .
when they got older , their horns started to grow up .
it 's interesting .
if you look along the кромки воротника , look at them треугольные bones , who grow up in the form of big triangles and then all line up along the воротника , just like шипы have пахицефалозавров .
later , because in my collection of a young males , i вскрыл them and looked inside .
i was a little губчатым .
the average had the same губчатое formation .
but interestingly , an adult трицератопс also had a губчатое formation .
and this is a skull , достигающий in two meters long .
it 's a big skull .
but there 's another a dinosaur , we ever found in exactly the same формации , which looks like трицератопс , but only it anymore , and it 's called торозавр .
and when we вскроем his bones , we see that it 's grown bone .
and everyone said , `` трицератопсы and торозавры can not be one species because one of the other anymore . ''
`` and and it has a hole in воротнике . ''
and i say , `` well , do we have any one young торозавр ? ''
and i say , `` no , but it has a hole in воротнике . ''
one of my favorites , john сканнелла , looked at the whole collection and realized that the hole beginning to emerge have a трицератопсов , of course , it 's a торозавров , and he also discovered a переходную form between трицератопсами and торозаврами , and it 's a wonderful discovery .
well , now we know that торозавры -- in fact выросшие трицератопсы .
now , when we 're giving the names of 've classified it that way , when we actually give the names of something , оригинальное name приклеивается ; it 's a new stuff -- it falls off .
well , the торозавры went extinct .
трицератопсы , if you 've ever heard in the news , a lot of дикторы realize this is wrong .
they think , you 've got to keep the name of the торозавры and throw -- трицератопсы , but it does n't happen .
well , the same thing we can do it with a bunch of other dinosaurs .
so , for example , эдмонтозавры and анатотитаны .
анатотитан : giant a duck is .
it 's a huge уткоклювый is .
and this is another .
well , we look at the гистологию bone .
the tissue says that эдмонтозавры -- the young males , at least , неполовозрелые , and the other is an adult , and this is онтогенез .
so , we dispose of them from анатотитана .
and we can keep this series .
the final -- t. rex .
here are two dinosaur : t. rex and нанотиранус .
what makes you think about it .
but there 's a good question .
they take a look at them and they said , `` have one 17 teeth , and have the very large -- 12 .
so it 's got to be true -- they have different kinds . ''
well , we вскрыли them .
and , lo and behold , нанотиранусов bones were young , and have bigger -- more than adults bone ,
it looks like he 's still growing .
in the museum of the mountain , where we work , is actually four t. rex , and i 'll be able to dissect .
i did n't have to open their each one of them , because i ended up creating a into a series of their jaws , and it turned out that some of the major -- 12 teeth , in one way that small -- 13 , even smaller has 14 teeth .
and , of course , the nano has 17 teeth .
we focused our efforts and studied a piece of other people , and as a result of that was discovered by 15 teeth .
we can again with the breeze say that онтогенез тираннозавра puts the stage нанотирануса , and , as a result , we исключаем another dinosaur .
well , when would come to an end меловой period , we have seven dinosaurs .
and it 's a great amount .
it 's a great amount , to be a вымершими , as i trust .
now , as you can imagine yourself , this is not very popular version of четвероклассников .
четвероклассники like dinosaurs , they will remember them .
and they do n't happy from that .
thank you very much .
so chris любезен .
i have no idea how you do this , chris .
all week -- the любезность . you can walk up to him and said , `` i 'm so sorry , chris , but i put your car .
finally , i do slammed into your house .
and he сгорел .
it 's just what your wife has gone from you would you say to make the best friend . ''
and you know , that he would say , `` thank you . ''
`` thank you for information , it 's very interesting . ''
`` thank you , which gave me around of the things that i do n't a подозревал . '' thank you .
thank you for what invited us .
one of the things that you are faced with появляясь , late one week at ted , is that it 's gradually , day after a day , other выступающие covers most of what you 're going to tell you .
fusion , i had a отведено at it 10 minutes .
spectroscopy is also .
and parallel вселенные .
and so this morning i thought , `` well , so i 'll just карточный the trick . ''
and it 's also have неактуально .
and today , a day иммануила , as we 've figured it out by now , right ?
иммануил ! ? of course .
i want to end with танцем…
but now it 's going to look pretty избито .
and this is what i decided -- after иммануила -- i could think of today 's first auction ted global .
with your for permission , i 'm going to start , it is a дешифратор for enigma .
who begin with 1,000 dollars ? anybody ?
thank you . and then the bruno said , `` no , no ввязывайся in it , please .
not a ввязывайся . you do n't need the . ''
i 'm worried . when i got invited , so they 're обронили between the job done , `` 15 minutes to change the world with this scene . '' 15 minutes to change the world .
i do n't know about you guys , and i 've got 15 minutes dates back to fix the wall .
the thought about changing the world , really , truly crow .
of course , now we know that we do n't have any repairing , we 've seen some amazing things беспроводного electricity is fantastic . you know , it 's inspiring .
300 years ago , it would сожгли with a firewood for it .
and now , it 's the idea .
ok . just fantastic .
and here you знакомитесь with fantastic people who see a completely different .
yesterday , there was another one , david deutsch , he раскрыл most of what i was going to do it .
but when you think of the world in a way , it turns a trip to the starbucks into something quite different , is n't it ?
i mean , in his establishment , they 'll say , `` you want маккиато , латте or американо , or капуччино ? ''
and he would say , `` you offer i sat изменчивые things . ''
`` how can it be your coffee like this ? ''
and they 'll say , `` do you mind if i обслужу the client ? ''
and as the очаровательна was yesterday илэйн морган ?
fantastic . very good .
her lecture of water обезьяне and communications , of course , the relationship of дарвинизмом and the fact that under that all we are naked -- not a волосатые , and we swimming around a pretty good .
and you know , she said she 90 . said that the amount of time истекает .
and it 's a отчаялась to find more now generated support for incidentally .
and then i thought , `` i 'm sitting next to льюисом a drink . ''
this man swimming around the north pole , what 's the evidence you need ?
and there it is .
so here 's what ted is enabling and connections .
i was n't there a tuesday . i did n't see statements гордона brown 's about приеме at work is mmmmm , sorry .
i 'm sorry .
so sorry . no , no. .
: `` the world 's problems that are шотландских decisions . ''
my fault has to do with what gordon brown , stepping out on the stage , looking for everybody , like the person in the медвежьем suit , which is just a really thought of bear .
: `` hello , tell you what happened there in the forest ?
oh , no , no , no. . ''
`` i 'm sorry . i have only 18 minutes , to talk about saving the world , preserving the planet , global institutions .
our work on climate change , and i 've just 18 minutes , unfortunately , i ca n't tell you about all the amazing things that we 're doing to take the program on climate change in the u.k. , like , for example , the third взлётно-посадочная band , планируемая at the airport heathrow… ''
`` the greatest and the coal farm , which we 're building in king's north , and , of course , some exciting news about what it is today only on this week , the only a wind engines britain was forced to закрыться .
unfortunately , there 's no time about this utter . ''
`` the british work for шотландцев…
no. . ''
`` do christian principles , do christian value .
not a убий , not a укради , not домогайся wives neighbor . ''
`` though , to be honest , when i was living in a hotel „number 11“ , it 's not causing problems . ''
: `` yeah , yeah , yeah .
come on , gordon .
can i just say a couple of things : first , about чери -- it 's an amazing woman , my wife , she has an amazing smile .
and it reminded me that you need to take a letter . ''
`` i think people forget , is that we with гордоном always a great ладили .
ok , but never , as a „горбатой горе“ . '' and i said to him , `` you know , before i leave the office , i wrote : `` i can count on your into the next month ? '' and he said , he said , `` no , you ca n't , you can't -lrb- the -rrb- . '' what удивило me , because i never have yet to see that kind of writing `` can't . ''
another thing was able to mention the gordon to talk to the public резиденции in 2002 -- it was refers to the building , people do n't listen .
but when talking about the financial industry , and he said , `` what do you as the city of london , made for financial times , , we , as a government , we hope to do with the rest of the economy . ''
when you think about what happens with that операциями , and see what happened in the economy , you 're making a message : `` this guy , who 's doing their promises . ''
but now we into the new world . we are in a completely new world .
this is the first time , i remember , when you get emails from the bank manager of займе , you do n't know , you do it занимаешь has money or he takes the money you have .
i 'm right ?
now , this is the amazing stuff -- the internet accounts in iceland .
does anyone here have a интернет-счёт in iceland ?
why would you do ? why is on the stage , above the answer on one of these letters of nigeria , right ?
in which they ask your реквизиты .
well , you know , iceland would never have created a limitations .
yes , it does n't gave an assurance .
it has that at all ? there 's a fish , and all the .
so a prime minister went on television . he said , `` it brought us a lot пикшы . ''
what i do is i had to try and explain the meaning of something before cut out of this entire бессмыслицу .
and very , very difficult to explain the financial crisis .
fortunately , helping people like a george w. bush .
he disappoint up over dinner , right .
by talking over dinner , and he said , `` wall street напился . ''
`` and now he has a похмелье . ''
and in this , you know , there 's что-то… something 's understandable us .
and something blindingly obvious to him .
and the second is , of course , was a дональд рамсфельд , who said , `` there 's a познанное knowledge is what we know about , that know .
and also , there 's a познанное -- other than knowing what we know about , we do n't know .
and there 's a непознанное other than knowing , this is what we do n't know , you do n't know . ''
and for the first time , i heard this , as a англичанин , i thought , `` what 's the crap . ''
but then becomes clear what it is .
it 's all , like said , ben бернанке , хаотическое developing world finance , about where they do n't know -- they do n't see what they were doing .
in 2006 , the head of the american association ипотечных bankers who had said , quote , `` as we see beauty , not estimated at all сейсмических things that really excited the economy of the united states of america . ''
and this man now on top of my career .
and when the crisis , using акционерного capital lehman brothers said , `` events , the model that прогнозировали real time in 10,000 years , happening every day for three days . ''
it 's amazing . it 's a new world , which is difficult to find a rational explanation .
but we have a new hope . new person .
the first избрала frankly of the black president .
wonderful news .
not only that , it 's a левша . you 'll notice ?
you know , a lot of people i обожаемых , distinguished artists , designers , thinkers , left-handed .
last night , somebody said to me , that if you левша , you need to be able to write without blobs of ink .
and on monday , somebody was talking about metaphors .
and i thought , which is a great metaphor , is n't it ? an american president who has to write , not the spots .
do you like it ? at the opposite of , as you can see , george бушу , well , what 's the metaphor here ?
i think it 's related to the idea of water обезьяне , right ?
`` well , you know , i 'm so sorry .
it 's a righty , but i think i did here напачкал . ''
but it 's not . now he 's gone .
eight years of american history , eight minutes went like this .
`` you know , this mistake end .
i suddenly realized that this was a big mistake .
some people say that they are convinced that this is one of the greatest errors in the history of the united states .
but we 've shown that they were wrong about iraq .
they said , we between iraq and the аль-каидой was no communication .
now there 's a . ''
`` and i have a message for террористов-смертников , for the people who взорвали myself . ''
`` we find you . ''
`` we can tell , what do you do n't do that again . ''
but now he 's gone , and it 's great to see is , like , one of the worst speakers in american history , a уступает place is one of the best -- obama .
it seems that you were there at night it to win .
speaking to the crowd in chicago , he said , `` if there 's any of you who are still misses is that america is a place where there might be все… ''
i ca n't take it all , it 's a very long time , to be true .
but you see the . and now it 's a инаугурацией .
he and the judge -- спотыкаясь about each other -- wrong to understand their words and spoil things .
and george w. bush 's sitting at that time , `` хи-хи-хи-хи-хи… ''
`` not so easy ? хи-хи-хи . ''
what 's interesting is that gordon brown was talking about цицероне , who said that people be heard it and they 'd say , `` this is great . ''
but they be heard демосфена and they 'd say , `` go out on march . ''
it 's really more like this quote from the movie `` should n't be . ''
do you remember that the movie with a helen ah , and джэком николсоном , where helen ah says джеку николсону : `` what are you found in me ? ''
and jack николсон says , `` because of you , i want to be better . ''
and you want to a leader , who inspire and dropping the challenge , and makes you want to be a better citizens . right ?
but at the moment , the right цицерон .
we like , what 's an obama , but we do n't do anything for that .
he 's coming down in this country , and he says , `` we need a big денежный stimulus . ''
and all подхватывают : `` great ! '' and he уезжает , and the french with the germans , people say , `` no , no , forget about this , of course , there 's no . '' nothing happens . it 's headed to the страсбург .
he says , `` we need more сапог afghan on earth . ''
and all подхватывают : `` a lovely idea . ''
he уезжает , and people are saying , `` no , no , no , we do n't go on it .
up -- 5,000 , and no rockets . no , no , it 's not going to . ''
he 's coming down the прагу and says , `` we believe in the безъядерный world . ''
and indeed , that 's an american president can выговорить the word `` resource , '' let 's first notice it .
you know , george w. bush : `` яд-рен-ный . ''
sorry , what ? `` яд-рен-ный . ''
can you say `` ядре́ный ? '' `` ядреный . ''
thank you very much .
and in that same day , north korea checks , to be able to do it , if that , обогнать china -- -- and put missile первее…
so , where we 're looking for inspiration ? we have still there 's a bill clinton .
`` i believe , that 's the president of the дуайт on эйзенхауэр сказал… . ''
`` вру , it was diana росс… ''
`` -- she said -- обратись and коснись… ''
`` ... чьих-то глан… away . ''
`` измени́те the world a better place , if you can .
i think it 's important . right .
and i hoped that the hillary would go to the white house , because it does n't have a home four years .
and i , you know . ''
`` and , when this endeavor , not succeed , i had to take some action . ''
here he is . in britain we have charles narrator : `` the environment is very important , all of that is that we have .
my wife constantly ссорится with me in trying to raise her fraction of the agenda . ''
or , as a выходцев in south africa , we will inspire mandela .
the great man mandela .
he was награждён his statue .
the previous one , that it was a reward in britain 's coming team сухопутных out on the садоводства .
`` what , nelson , as you the device to improve your water ? ''
`` ээ , listen , mr. титчмарш . ''
`` i performed in jail for about 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
the кой me this чёртово device for the water ? ''
very quickly : i сомневался , what i 'm going to end this talk , but yesterday that the man came up with a great quote from the japanese `` очерков about idleness '' -- which the bottom line is , it 's been something неоконченным , because it means that there 's a space for growth .
thank you very much .
hi , i 'm here to talk to you about the importance of похвалы , an and gratitude , and make sure that they were its own personal and искренними .
i started to think about it , and i noticed for me , as a child , and to making some time in the past , when i had to say thank you to somebody , wanted to похвалить , i wanted to me a похвалили for some reason , i just would often stop .
and i asked myself , why ?
i was feeling a shame , стеснение .
and i have a question , i part of that ?
and i decided to explore this .
i was lucky enough to work in rehab , so i see a lot of people who live with his addiction and die from it .
and sometimes it comes down to something very one easy , like for example , they actually something very profound there may be a loving wound is , their father died , do n't say they no словo about how he a proud of it .
but then they hear from the entire family and friends that father used to say to everybody , as he proud to them , but he never talked about it for my son .
it 's because he did n't realize that his son , you need to hear it .
and here 's my question is , why do n't we 're asking about the things that we need ?
i know one man , женатого for 25 years , that they would желал , to his wife said to him , `` thank you for what you содержишь family , and i can sit at home with my kids '' -- -- but he never would ask for a about it .
and i know the woman is in this преуспевшую .
it , once a week , part of it with my husband and says , `` i want you to поблагодарил me for all of what i 'm doing around the house , and for children . ''
and he says , `` oh , it 's so great , so it 's cool . ''
похвала needs to be a искренней , but it is to take responsibility for it .
and one of my friend , эйприл with which we дружим in kindergarten , благодарит their children for doing domestic actions .
and she said , `` why can i not them to thank , even if they 're supposed to do this . ''
so , the question is , why is it that i сопротивляюсь ?
why is it that other people repel ?
why can i say , `` i want to средне прожаренный steak , i need a sixth of the shoes , '' -- did n't say , `` can you похвалить me for this ?
and this is because , so i 'm going to give you a very important information about ourselves .
i 'm telling you where i was very weak place .
i mean , where i need your help .
and i 'm going to do with you , with their families , like what you my enemies .
because what you can do with it ?
you can i ignore .
you can злоупотребить my trust .
or you can just go up to me .
i took my bike is sort of a prototype -- i love this -- the same bike , and there are they doing something called `` регулировка колес . ''
he says , `` you know , when the отрегулируешь колёса , the bike becomes a lot better . ''
i got the same bike back , but they fixed all these little defects in the same the колесах , that i had two and a half , and my bicycle . as a new .
so what i 'm going to give you a task .
i want you to отрегулировали your wheel is : be honest about the похвалы that you want to hear .
what you want to hear ? let 's go home to my wife , let 's go and ask her that she needed .
let 's go back to my husband is that he needed ?
let 's go back and ask those questions , and then help the people around you .
it 's that simple .
but why we need to actually take care about this ?
we 're talking about the world around the world .
but how do we make a peace in the world of different cultures , different languages ?
i think it starts from a family to the family , under one крышей .
so let 's start out with our own backyard .
and i want to thank all of you in this room for what you мужья beautiful , beautiful mothers , the friends , the daughter , sons .
and maybe , no one никода not say to you , but this is what you 've done -- it 's a very , very good job .
thank you , thank you for what you here , just came and changing the world your ideas .
thank you .
about 17 years ago , i had a аллергия on air delhi .
the doctors told that bottle of your lungs , i have decreased 70 percent , and that 's a убийственно for me .
and содействии итт teri and looking at work nasa we found three simple , that plants , through which you can get a clean air , as long as you need for the sake of health in the room .
we also found out that we can reduce the supply of the building for your house in the air , and it 's not a нарушая нормативы by grade air in the rooms .
these three plants , it 's a арековая palma , сансевиерия and сциндапсус .
the botanical names in front of you .
арековая palma -- this is a plant that absorbs the co2 , and turn it into oxygen .
we had to grow them on биогумусе , in стерильных conditions , on гидропонике , and every three to four months выставлять them on the street .
and the second thing is , сансевиерия , again , is very popular plant , we call it a растением for the bedroom , because it takes co2 and oxygen at night .
the human 6-8 plants need the height of the талию .
and the third is a plant , сциндапсус , again , a very popular plant , the best grows on гидропонике .
this is a plant absorbs the формальдегид and other летучие chemicals .
these three plants are able to provide the total amount fresh air .
in fact , if you want to a закупоренной bottle , you do n't need a chance of death -- in the air свежем gone .
we tried these plants in delhi , in our own building for 20 years building , of the 4,500 square meters .
it is almost 1,200 these plants for 300 staff .
our studies have shown that the chance of 42 percent dissolved oxygen is the blood growing at one percent of the people who spent 10 hours in this building .
the government of india опубликовало study about what our building is the useful for the health of the building new delhi .
the study showed that , compared to other buildings cases раздражения eye there is less than the 52 percent , disorders дыхательных systems -- the 34 percent , головных is on the way to 24 percent , of the lung is to 12 percent , and asthma -- at nine percent .
a study published eight of september , 2008 , it is available on the website of the government of india .
our experience shows that because of these plants productivity increases incredibly -- more than 20 percent .
in addition to that , i have a 15 percent is decreasing the amount of power in a building , because the fresh air , takes less .
and we 're doing the same thing in a building of the 160,000 square meters , in which will put 60,000 plants .
what 's the matter ?
and it 's important for the environment , because the need for energy возрастёт in the next decade by 30 percent .
now , 40 percent of the world 's energy than the buildings , and in the next 15 years , 60 percent of the population of the earth is going to live in our buildings in cities with a population of more than a million people .
in addition , everything else preferred отдаётся проживанию and work in places with кондиционированным air .
`` you wish to the world has changed , are the стань that we 've done , '' said mahatma gandhi .
i thank you for your attention .
13 billion dollars in a эквиваленте испарились from the economy in the last two years .
evolved doubt about the future of capitalism .
evolved doubt about the financial system .
evolved doubt about the state надзора .
we have to think about , where we 're going .
but at the same time , we can with a certainty to talk about the verge moment in american history , the ability to take the perspective on themselves and make us in a different way of america .
i call this great затишье .
at the top of the mind is a very simple idea , which is that the consumer went from the shape of the concerns to take action .
consumers , the ones that have to 72 percent of gdp of america , started , as and banks , as and business , reduce the use of кредитов , and started in everyday life give up the неустойчивых and рискованных surgeries , which appear on their different ways .
so that was more in with , and i want to stress that the consumer is not капитулировал .
on the contrary , consumer became stronger .
in order to do that , you can look back , and look at what happened in the last for about a year and a half .
and if you do n't have a here , here marks the for чайников '' about what happened in the economy . okay ?
unemployment . high price down on the property . фондовые markets down .
разнонаправленны consumer prices .
if you were домохозяйкой and were trying to the budget , with the wisdom of what oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer , and now somewhere between 100 , 150 dollars , you would запланировали off ? what would you buy ?
what 's the strategy in your home agriculture ?
whether it 's going to happen ? субсидирование national debt , detroit , the cost of health care , currencies . this is what issues up in front of us .
let 's look back and see what caused a crisis , because the consumers , all of us , in a normal life , in fact , they 're many of these problems .
this is what i call the `` paradox 50-20 . ''
50 years went into the level of savings rate of about 10 percent . 50 years .
you know , why there 's been so high ?
there was the second world war . do you know why savings rate was so high ?
there was nothing to buy , other than the actual money , right ?
so , what actually happened over the last 20 years , we 've gone from the level of savings rate in 10 percent of the отрицательным значениям .
we started a переедать . сверх-большие to buy a car , all the приставкой `` экстра '' -- even buy the medication of уставших legs .
all of this combined and created the factor , which is the consumer and brings us to the breakdown , with which we have today .
the average attitude debt to the income has grown from 65 percent to 300 percent in the last 15 years .
consumers are неплатежеспособными .
and this also happened with банками , and also with the federal government .
here 's a ошеломляющий graph .
it shows you платежеспособность at a time when 1919 in 2009 .
for the depth of what happened was made from here , you can point out of the fact that , in fact , if we look forward , just 're burning through the future of education and the future of our children in our homes .
if you look at this in the context of a visualization national security , you 'll see that if fold it кипу a долларовых купюр , to begin with , 360 10,000 dollars , and it 's going to be the size of the with the average person .
if you go to fold , so you can see the tremendous amount of money , who was a вложен in the system as a national security .
this is the first 315 billion .
and yet , recently i вычитал that trillion seconds equals 32 thousands of years , and if you think about it , the context and регулярность with which we talk about триллионной government supported by here , or for the other place that is , in fact , to the долговой яме , in which we put themselves .
however , consumers have changed .
they were ответственнее .
we see the rise of the level of накоплений .
the accumulation was growing in the space of 11 months from the beginning of this crisis .
we отыграли minus and are at stage 10 percent .
also , what is remarkable is that in the fourth quarter consumption fall to the lowest level in the last 62 years , a reduction in about three . seven percent .
visa отчиталась of what is now дебетовые cards are used more than credit cards .
so we 're starting to pay for the merchandise on our means that we have .
and we 're starting to behave осторожнее with what we накапливаем , and with that , in that investing .
but it 's not all .
but it was an extraordinary time for change .
we went through a highly неустойчивое position .
if you take in mind , the fact that 80 percent of americans were born after the second world war , then in principle , and it 's going to be a depression of our time .
as a result , there are some remarkable things .
i 'll give you some examples . so let 's talk about дантистах , вазэктомии , оружии and нападении sharks . okay ?
dentists отчитались about укреплении positions , it seems that people have размалывать their teeth , they show up and tell us that stress .
in addition to that , and shape of the number of people who had to change пломбы .
the number of times вазэктомии up by 48 percent , according to the institute of school at cornell .
and finally , there 's a good time , perhaps , and not 's attached to the things about the ones i 've just described to you , is that the number of нападений sharks on people 's sparse from 2003 .
does anybody know why ?
the beaches опустели . and so all in there 's lightly pigmented side .
but seriously , what 's going on , and the reason that i want to argue is a неугнетенность perspective , which lies in a tremendous opportunity for the consumer , приведшего us to the recession , take us back .
i mean , what you can do you go from бездумного consumption to обдуманному consumption . right ?
уменьшая your demand , consumers уравнивают their income and wasted , and so are capitalism and business , not to разрастанию , or to improve .
right now , and i 'll explain it .
and based on a калькуляторе потребительских taste , a патентованном instrument companies vml and the young one ; rubicam , we begin to understand what happened at the problem with a потребительским market .
you can find a couple of really interesting things .
let 's go to the four of change in the values , отражающих new consumer behaviors , and предлагающих new principles of governance .
the first shift in values and you can see the tendency toward a so-called , flexible life .
it 's moving from the americans , оценивающих their успешность on how many things in owned by the needs of the flexibility , because the излишеств less than you are , the more dynamic and light on the rise of the you step .
as a result , there was actually внеклассовое consumption .
and the idea внеклассового consumption is that тратя money mindlessly , you start to look a little bit of not much cooler .
money is the main factor in management .
let 's look at some of the examples внеклассового consumption , the выпадающие of myself values .
first of all , it 's going to happen , because the p дидди поклялся become less glamorous because god .
and if you 're serious , so you can now look at the phenomenon of one медисон avenue , and in other places , where people прогуливаются on a роскошным бутикам with the standard , nothing примечательными `` paper plastic bags , to hide expensive purchases .
people started a торговаться in бутиках .
торговаться began when you buy of luxury and real estate .
we 're seeing relaxation ego , a reduction in part роскошных things .
and here is the story of яхт-клуба , almost all of the people who are `` blue it . ''
яхт-клуб for `` blue воротничков o , and in order to be in it , you need to work on a лодочном backyard , it 's a kind of a condition for членства .
there is also the trend in tourism , it becomes more сдержанным . right ?
агротуризм , the duration of the виноградники and farms .
in that you can see the attempt to get away from the monetary relationships .
what do business can do to consistent with the new установкам consciousness is really interesting .
some really standing things .
for example , a company frito-lay found one thing about variability their users .
they saw their consumers are really powerful more money at the beginning of the month , and at the end of a smaller . and they started to change the packaging goods .
a sandwich in начеле months , in a smaller at the end of the month .
and the exciting things like this moment san francisco giants .
they 've introduced a mechanism динамических prices .
take account of steel everything from побед athletic and weather to a расписания матчей , and bringing price for customers .
another quick example of these things -- this is the emergence of zynga .
zynga came as a reflection of the customers do n't be a связанными фиксированными the prices .
and меняющаяся the price of a reflection меняющейся life .
микроплатежей became a tremendous amount .
and , finally , some people are using hulu as a way to reduce the payments for cable tv .
so , really smart ideas , like these , started to bring a service , and it 's been understood marketers .
and the second one out of four values -- this is the pursuit of этичности and an honest game .
and the game is fills a good отношением and respect .
this is the consumer demands .
and the result is now business has got to not just value , but a set of values .
all the more consumer look very much at the culture of the company , the behavior of the company in the market .
so , what with empathy and respect , is a really обнадеживающих things out there on the lights out of this recession .
i 'll give you some examples .
the first is разрастание communities and neighbors ' relationships , and which is выраженность your neighbors as your relying and support .
also , a beautiful byproduct seems to be a horrible things like unemployment is increasing in the number of volunteers , замеченное in our country .
another наблюдаемый phenomenon -- some of you might be `` возвратившиеся kids '' -- now , `` возвратившиеся graduates '' : universities возобновили connected with выпускниками and help them with his work , an opportunity to share skills and переподготовкой .
we also talked about character and профессионализме .
this wonderful приводнение aircraft on the surface of the hudson river in new york city , in january of this year , and all of a sudden sally clark was the most popular name for the at birth .
so , in terms of values and values , companies can organize networks to communicate in different ways .
microsoft does something spectacular .
they are able to it . провозгласили education for two million americans , using the web as infrastructure for something good .
also think about the experience of companies gore-tex .
gore-tex killed a персональными зарплатами of management and employees , and that 's what they basically refused to the idea of having a боссов .
and they say , that , in fact , all of their spending , all of them a management of a cost , have been put on the inside the corporate site , so everybody could see it .
so , complete transparency .
so think twice before you get a bottle of wine .
the third of four values пост-кризисного consumption requires a long-term perspective in terms of life .
so our data , you can see what consumers actually realized that life is a marathon , not спринт .
they копают deeper than that . and seek out of the way increasing the value of every buying a mistake .
in a testament you can use the fact that americans are leading sharing longer than ever before , nine , four years on average . this is the record .
we also see that library became popular in america .
you know , that 68 percent of americans now have a библиотечную card ?
it 's the highest result in the history of nations .
and in this тренде , you can see the pursuit of накоплению knowledge .
all the larger number of people learns continuously .
all сфокусировано on improving , for development , and moving forward .
is a movement `` do myself . ''
i was a воодушевлен , when i learned that 30 percent of all the houses in america are actually built their people in .
it 's basically коттеджи and things like that . but it builds takes 30 percent .
people are an afraid запачкать hands . people закатывают it .
they need these skills .
if you look at the хай-лайн in new york city , we 're going to see a nice example переосмысления existing infrastructure , under the good stuff , which is a whole new park in new york city .
so , brands and and companies can afford дивиденды consumers , to be a долгоиграющими брендами , offering transparency and promise to be in the line , and then today in распродажи .
that 's a great example of this is patagonia .
the company patagonia's footprint chronicles shows the path of each of them a product , gives you a sense of social responsibility and understand the этическую side of it produced products .
another example is a gorgeous fidelity .
instead of just a return rate of rewards in кредитным or дебетовым покупкам , they offer 529 of rewards undergraduate вузов .
another interesting company sunrun .
i love this company . they 've created a community consumers , people put solar panels on their homes and make up to the very потребительскую value , because генерируемое electricity in the part comes back into the market .
so , this community , управляемое consumers .
the value of пост-кризисного consumption is the tendency return to the public .
now it 's incredibly important .
as we know , trust can not be поделено apart .
now comes the integration of communities , the integration of social networks .
in my book , i put up a fact that 72 percent of the people trust the on what other people would say about бренде or company , the ads are trust the only 15 percent .
now , here 's the thing , which has a collaborative consumption was проигнорировано .
this is the consumer , working together on trying to get up on the market , what they want .
let 's look at a couple of examples here .
grows кустарное production .
and also , all in terms of the products and services local producers , supporting local communities , whether it 's a cheese wine , or other products .
also grow local currency .
make sure you leave knowing you in the current situation difficult to get a loan , you 're going to have to do business with people who trust in your local markets .
so , the growth of local currencies is very interesting феноменом .
more recently , i got a report , which led me to the excited about .
a couple of communities in the united states recently began to include the data about using the people of electricity .
and they found that when these data are public , in those societies rate did come down the amount of electricity .
now let 's take a look at the idea of the people together to buy the meat , заключающейся is that consumers are put together together to buy the meat with organic produce farm , that they think the are safe and контролируются as people would want them to контролировались .
another interesting pattern here you can see here in california -- it 's каррот-моб .
traditionally , we 're used to бойкотам , right ?
you have the help ? well why would n't be part of каррот-моба .
and now let 's take a look at what companies can do .
there 's an opportunity to be организующей by the community .
you have to bear in mind , that you ca n't deal with someone , or trying to control .
you just get organized .
you have to use it . you have to give it a meaning .
you can see lots and lots of interesting examples of how it works .
as the first examples , you can give you the recent the fact that the zagat 's not worth on the ground and by rating restaurants рейтингам диверсифицировался from the health care system .
what are the conditions for letting zagat do this ?
in fact , a lot of them -- because they are a network of people . right ?
now if we look at the phenomenon of kogi .
this is not just a restaurant . it 's a перемещающийся truck . right ?
they travel around the лос-анжелесу . and the only way to find them -- this is from twitter .
and if you look at the momversations from johnson more one ; johnson .
there was actually created a феноменальный blog .
and it 's a j more one ; the j gets to support from of bloggers , mama , allowing them to create forums , in which you can be able to communicate and organize networks to connect .
but it was also very , very efficient рекламной company to j more one ; j .
all of this суммируется with a феноменальной job of leadership from the ford to zappos , using twitter , making an open environment , can become part of the company процесса- instead of being a спрятанными over the walls of the city .
you can see нарастающую power in total transparency and transparency , to which started pointing companies . it 's because the consumers are there .
so , if you take a step back , to see it as a whole , which i 'm sure what exists today crisis is an absolute reality .
he was by consumers .
but at the same time , it opens up a huge opportunity .
and the chinese character for the crisis on the side of the same coin .
the crisis of possibilities .
what 's going on with consumers , in fact , there 's an opportunity for them to take us from the recession .
we believe that ценностно-ориентированные spending will do better capitalism .
they make for innovation .
they have to produce products with a lot сроком life . they 're making a better , more visceral service for the audience .
they are us the opportunity to connect with companies , разделяющими the same values , what we 're .
and when we look back and go from that , when we 're going to see the beginning of these trends that we have in our data , we 're going to see a any encouraging ahead of america .
thank you very much .
narrator : i am .
and that 's what i 'm is telling stories , i write novels . today i 'd like to tell you some stories about art telling stories , and it 's also about some of the сказочных species , which зовутся джинами .
but before i do that , let me share with you my personal story .
in that will help me , of course , the words , and also the geometric figure is a circle . and over the course of my story , we would meet some circles .
i was born in страсбурге , in france , have турецких parents .
and my parents did , and i moved in turkey with my mother .
since then , i grew up as a single child матери-одиночки .
in the early 70е in the анкаре was it a little bit unusual .
in the neighborhood lead a large families , where the fathers were always the in the house . i was seeing my mother is a разведенную woman -- in a патриархальной environment .
in fact , i was raised by looking for two different types of women .
on the one hand was my mother 's well-educated , светская , modern , прозападная турецкая woman .
on the other hand was my grandmother , which is also took care of me -- more spiritual , образованная less and less , obviously , рациональная .
here was a woman who гадала on the кофейной thick , to see the future and плавила lead to загадочные forms , to protect the сглаза .
my grandmother посещало a lot of people with a horrific высыпаниями on his face or бородавками on our hands .
every time the grandmother произносила some words in arabic , had taken red apple and пронзала his шипами роз , in a number of things , равном number of the бородавок that she wanted to remove .
after that , in each other 's обводила these шипы темными чернилами .
a week later , the patient came to actually looking .
i know that 's not supposed to talk about it in front of an audience scientists and scientific employees , but frankly , of all the people who come to my grandmother with all of the skin , i do n't have any number of people who came to недовольным or неизлеченным .
i would say , as it does it . it was whether it 's praying ?
and she 'd say , `` yeah , that 's effective , but also need to be circles forces . ''
and in many other things , from it , i got a very valuable lesson . if you want to kill something , for example , прыщ порок or the human soul , all you have to do is окружить their fat walls of the city .
and they иссохнут on the inside .
now we all live in a social and cultural round , .
we 're born into a family , определнной nations , the classroom .
but if we do n't have contacts with other worlds , in addition to that , and it 's given us the default , then there 's the risk of высохнуть on the inside .
our imagination can ослабеть . heart -- уменьшиться . and our common humanity is a поблекнуть , if too long within reach of our cultural коконов .
our friends , neighbors , friends , family , if all the people in our environment походят on us -- what i mean by that is that we are surrounded with their зеркальными отражениями .
another thing that makes women like my grandmother in turkey is put a mirror бархатом or are they face the wall .
that 's the eastern tradition . it is the fact that people do n't have to spend too much time to look at your reflection .
so , ironically , that lives in societies are equally intelligent is one of the largest опасностей глобализированного situation in the world .
and that 's going on everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , агностиков and верующих , rich and poor , east and west .
we have a tendency to form of based on схожести , and then people 's stereotypes about other groups .
in my view , cross the limits of these cultural ghettos through art , you can tell stories .
history is not разрушат borders , but they can holes in the walls of our consciousness .
and through those holes , we 'll be able to see мельком another world , and sometimes we can will like , what we 're going to see .
i started writing , when i was eight .
and one day , my mother came home with a бирюзовой тетрадью and said , i do n't want to have a personal journal .
now i think she did a little nervous about my психическом health .
i always did tell stories at home , which was good , but i did tell them with their imagining fully friends , which was not very nice .
i was ребенком-интровертом , to the point that spoke to the with crayon illustrations of color and извинялась in front of things , if i натыкалась on them . she thought i go on to write the daily experiences and emotions .
she did n't know what i believed in their lives is a really boring and the last thing i wanted to do is write about myself .
instead , i started to write about other people and things that would never happen .
so writing became the passion of my life .
at the very beginning of literature , was n't the for me обнародованием memoirs , and the extraordinary journey to the rest of your life and opportunity .
okay , отнеситесь me to understand . i 'm a circle and go back to this point .
around the same time , there was a big .
my mom was a diplomat .
and from that little , суеверного , the average environment around my grandmother , i was a втянута in this шикарную , an international school , where i was the only турчанкой .
here , i had the first way , which i call `` a typical иностранец . ''
we 're in a classroom children were all races . however , diversity , not necessarily lead to the free from предрассудков , there for democracy in the classroom .
instead , it 's created the atmosphere , where every child принимался , not as a kind of identity is itself , but as a proxy of something larger .
and we were like miniature are nations , it was funny , except of the times when something happened increases , novel about one of the or religion .
the child , who was their representing that had been насмешкам , осмеянию and a запугиванию .
i know what i say , because it was at that time , there was a revolution in my country , a terrorist my nationality just do n't kill my dad and turkey has got a zero on еровидении .
then i often missed school and wanted to be a моряком
here , for the first time , i realized the taste of cultural thinking .
the children would ask me about the movie `` полуночный express , '' which i had never seen before . they kept asking , how many cigarette in the day , i выкуриваю , because people thought that all турки -- заядлые курильщики . and been trying , at the age of what i 'm going to start to cover the head .
i heard about my country , there are three main man box , a politician , cigarettes , and with the name of burqa .
after spain , we have moved in жордан , in germany , and again in анкару .
everywhere i had the sense that my imagination is the only baggage , which i can take with you .
you give me a story support structure , the continuity and логичность , something that i always miss .
when i was a twenties , i went to стамбул , city , which i восхищалась .
i was living in a living , многообразном neighborhood where i wrote some of my novels .
when i выбежала of buildings at three o'clock in the morning , my way through something преградило .
it was a local бакалейщик -- сварливый , an old man , which does n't sell them alcohol and have a conversation with маргиналами .
he was sitting next to the трансвестита with long black париком and тушью , стекавшей on her щекам .
i 've seen as a man opened him a cigarette трясущимися hands and one proposed to her . this is a picture of me from the left in the middle of the night -- консервативный бакалейщик and плачущий трансвестит , курящие together on the side of the street .
in the face of death and destruction of our earth differences evaporate , and we 're all едины , even though for a few hours .
but i 've always believed that history under a effect on us .
i 'm not suggesting that the power of сопоставима with the power of the earthquake . but when we read a novel , we are leaving our little , уютные apartment in the back , go back alone in the night and a better understanding of people , which has never met before , and maybe even предвзято them do .
shortly after , i went to the female college in boston , then in michigan .
it was n't just change from there right now , but change language .
i started writing in english .
i do n't a эммигрант , or a refugee ссыльный . i would ask , why am i doing that . but the переключение between languages gives me the opportunity to взбодриться .
i love writing in turkish , which i think is very поэтичным and emotional . and i love writing in english , which is very delicate and intelligent .
and everybody 's like , i feel different attachment .
for me , as a million of other people around the world , english is the second language .
and when you start learning the language of late , do you live with him with repeat the sense of frustration .
we also want to say anymore , отмочить jokes посмешнее , to say something more interesting . but in the end , we are talking smaller , because there 's a gap between the mind and the language .
and this gap is very устрашает .
but if we 're going to learn not пугаться him , and he also may be getting us .
that 's what i 've learned in boston -- frustration can promote .
in this period , my grandmother , which watched my life with a возрастающим беспокойством , started a pray for this to me more quickly get married and остепенилась times and forever .
and because god loves her , i really got married .
but instead , to buckle down , i moved in arizona .
and because my husband was in istanbul , i started a метаться between аризоной and стамбулом -- the two places on earth , that would be more different .
i think that part of me has always been кочевником physically and spiritually .
the stories they me , connecting my work and memories , as a экзистенциальный glue .
how would i had no history , recently , i began to think that they lose their magic , when something far more to the story .
i just wanted to together , we were thinking about it .
when my first book in english stepped in america , i had an interesting comment of литературного criticism .
`` i liked your book , '' he said , `` but i wish you put it in a different way . ''
and i said , what they mean .
he said , `` look , there are so many испанских , american , latino characters , but only one турок and the man . ''
the action , the book was going on in the boston area on a university campus , and so for me , there was no wonder that there was more разнонациональных characters , the турков . but i realized that i 've been looking for my critic .
and i realized that i 'm going to continue разочаровывать him .
he wanted to see a my personality .
he was looking for a book турецкую woman , because i am a her .
we often talk about the history of changing the world , but we also need to see how the world of the politics of individuals affects the way in the history of this , читаются and рецензируются .
a lot of writers sense this pressure , but не-западные -- the sense of his harder .
if you a женщина-писатель of the muslim world , as i , from you 're waiting , what are you going to write the stories about a muslim women , and , hopefully , несчастливые history miserable muslim women .
wait , what are you going to write a информативные , пронзительные and : those stories and оставишь experiments and авангард western colleagues .
one of the things that i felt at a kid in the school in madrid , the литературном happens in the world today .
all of us are waiting to something very specific , if not специфического .
the writer , james болдуин gave an interview in 1984 , in which it several times asked about his homosexuality .
when the interviewer tried to stick it on a label писателя-гея , the болдуин paused and said , `` do n't you see ? in me no big deal , we would n't be others and others , there 's nothing that are n't in me . ''
when a politician , trying to навесить on us ярлыки , danger are our freedom and imagination .
there 's a смутная category , which is called мультикультурной literature , in which all authors outside of the western world get mixed together .
i never will forget its first мультикультурные reading at a harvard street ten years ago .
we had three writer , the one with the philippines , one of the turkey , and one of the indonesia , . прям as a анекдоте .
we brought together , not because we had a similar art , or литературным so on ,
and just for our documents .
from мультикультурных authors have always are not a выдуманных ; it 's a real stories .
function , приписываемая literature .
in this case , not only writers , but and their characters are a sample of something larger .
i 'm also going to point out that this tendency to see in the history of something larger comes , not just from the west .
it comes over the tree of life .
i learned that at a personal experiences , when i went to the court in 2005 in the words of my выдуманного character , произнесенные in novel .
i want to write a созидательный , многослойный novel about армянской and турецкой family in terms of women .
it 's that little story првевратилась in big , there 's a scandal , when i предъявили судебный complaint .
somebody me a критиковал , somebody хвалил , for what i wrote about турецко-армянском конфликте .
but sometimes i wanted to remind both sides of the conflict , that it was a fiction .
just a story .
and when i say , `` just a story , '' i 'm not trying to none умалить his job .
i want to love and his literature credit for what it is , but not for what it is the means .
writers express their opinions about politics and there 's a lot of beautiful novels of politics , however , is not the language of everyday language politics .
чехов said , `` the solution to the problem and good design problems are two very different things .
and the last thing is the only goal of a writer . ''
politics is the individual . we divide the literature together .
some people interested in общностях ,
somebody in нюансах .
someone 's borders .
it 's not the other .
the thing is made up of solid bricks .
literature -- this is flowing water .
at the time of the оттоманской empire existed the рассказчики-кочевники , which звались '' меддах . ''
they went around the кофейням and tell stories in front of an audience , often импровизируя .
with every new действующим face in history , меддах changes voice пародируя character .
it could come in and listen to the people , even султан , muslims and not muslims .
the history of any cross borders . like , for example , '' history ходжи насреддина , '' and they were very aware of the average east , north africa , балканам and asia .
today 's history , go to transcend borders .
when talking the palestinian and the israeli government , they usually do n't listen to each other . but the palestinian story appears to be read a novel jew writer and vice versa , соединяясь and сочувствуя author .
literature , there should возносить us on those .
if she could n't do it , so it 's not too good literature .
books have saved застенчивого ребенка-интроверта , which i used to be .
but i 'm also very well know about опаности them идеализации .
when the poet and мистик rumi met a spiritual компаньона шамса табризи , the first thing that has made the final -- emitted books rumi in the water , and watching the way the fall out .
суфисты says , `` the knowledge that 's up above your self , much worse ignorance . ''
the problem with your cultural ghettos is not a lack of knowledge . we know a lot of each other , or at least , so we count . but the knowledge that we do n't возвышает on themselves just that makes us разрозненными and отстраненными .
there 's the metaphor that i love so much , to live , as компас .
as you know , one стрелка compass needle is static and lies in one place .
the same стрелка describes the circle , constantly moving at all .
and the same thing happens with my произведениями .
one of the вросла its roots in стамбул and has the highest турецкие roots . whereas the other part is traveling around the globe in contact with other cultures .
in that sense , i like to think of my writing , how about the local and universal at the same time , thus over the tree of life .
those of you who was in istanbul you may have seen the palace топкапи , which is more than 400 years являлся резиденцией оттоманских султанов .
in this дворце , the right behind the комнатами наложниц , there is a focus джинов .
it 's between the buildings .
i заинтриговала concept .
it 's usually do n't trust the places that are between a ridiculous .
we think they владением supernatural creatures , such as a джины , who are made up of бездымного fire and are symbols of неуловимости .
i mean , what неуловимое space is that most need authors and artists .
when i write , i really неуловимость and variability .
i love does n't know what 's going to happen in 10 pages .
i like when my characters me удивляют .
i can write about a мусульманской woman in a novel , and maybe it 's going to be a good story . and in the next book , i might write about a nice профессоре-гее from norway .
we can write about it , if it comes from our сердец .
одри lord once said , `` the white fathers were taught us to say , `` i think , therefore i am . ' '' and she said , `` i feel , so i свободна . ''
i mean , it was a beautiful change paradigms .
and yet , why on in изобретательного letters , number one , what we teach students -- it 's write something , and what do you know ?
maybe it 's not the right now the beginning .
we need to educate the young people and themselves to unveil our hearts and writing about what we experience .
we have to get out of our cultural ghettos and start to travel .
in the end , the history of the work like a кочевники drawing of a circle .
they connect all of humanity , in spite of politics personalities . and that 's the good news .
and i 'd like to conclude by the old стихом суфи . '' приди , let us be friends ; let us to push back the life ; let us be a любовниками and be lovers ; you would n't have to go to . ''
thank you .
we live in a heavy economic times .
and one of the first victims heavy economic times , i think , are out of public expenditure , but , of course , at the moment , the most a vulnerable position is the science budget at all , and research science and developments in particular .
so , i 'm going to try to convince you of about 15 minutes that 's абсурдная and actually very perverse .
but first , i think , is to establish the декорации '' for my действа . i want to show you -- the next slide is not an attempt to show the worst slide in the history of ted , but there 's a little bit is complicated .
but that 's not my fault . this is a plot of the guardian newspaper . ''
and , in fact , it 's a beautiful demonstration of how much it costs science .
so what i 'm trying to convince all that we should continue to highlight the money to explore and research science , i should tell you how much does it cost .
so , a game called `` match me as a scientific budget . ''
this is a general of the united kingdom .
a budget is -- if you look up here , on the left there , there are a bunch purple peanuts , and the next to them , a жёлтых peanuts .
and this is one of these little жёлтых peanuts , right next to the big yellow blob .
it 's like three -- three billion of 620 billion pounds a year .
this is the budget of all science in the u.k.
including medical research , space exploration , , particle physics , engineering , and even social and humanitarian science , is by all of the science budget , those are the three -- three billion , the little yellow ball , just up the road from оранжевого marbles inside on one side of the screen .
this is a piece of our conversation .
this one percent of earners , by the way , about одинаков in the united states , germany and france .
all the research and конструкторская work , финансируемая by the government , which is about zero . six percent of gdp .
that 's what we 're talking .
the first thing i 'd like to say , and it 's the `` wonders of the solar system , '' is that our solar system and the universe studies have shown us , how they неописуемо look beautiful .
this picture was taken by the cassini space probe the orbit of saturn , already after that съёмок `` wonders of the solar system . ''
so it 's not walked into the .
this is a picture of saturn moon enceladus .
we have a huge white sphere in the corner -- it 's saturn , which is the background of the image .
and this is a полумесяц enceladus , which in size , pretty much like the british island .
about 500 kilometers .
the tiny moon .
but what завораживающе beautifully .
the thing is , you can see on the лимбе , which is призрачные jets smoke , moving up with лимба .
this is how we introduced this process in `` the solar system . ''
a beautiful picture .
and what we found is that these jets призрачные are фонтанами ice поднимающимися on the surface of this tiny moon .
and it 's pretty amazing by itself , but we think this machine running these фонтаны in motion it involves liquid water under the surface of the moon .
and that 's very important is , this is what 's on our planet , on earth , wherever we find some liquid water , we find life .
so anyway , ingenious evidence that there is a lakes of liquid underneath the surface of the planet within a billion 200 million miles away from the earth ошеломляет .
what do i mean by that is that it 's good for life .
well , it was just a ct representation , better than i 'll show you a picture .
here 's another picture of enceladus .
by , when the cassini flew under enceladus .
he made a very intimate path , just a few hundred miles above the surface .
and this is , again , a picture of ice фонтанов , поднимающихся in space , a very beautiful .
but that 's not the first candidate for the presence of life in the solar system .
it 's likely that area , europe , which is the moon around jupiter .
we had to go to the юпитеру to figure out what the moon is not just a dead stone , like most of the moons .
in fact , it 's a ледяная moon .
so what you see here is the surface of the moon in europe , fat layer of ice , in a hundred kilometers thick .
but with the extra dimensions of how europe interacting with apply a magnetic pulse of jupiter , and watching the cracks in the ice , which you can see in this image , we really have felt underneath the surface of europa there 's an ocean of liquid .
under the ice , there 's an ocean of liquid , покрывающий this moon at all .
we tend to think of water in it a солёная , and what that means is , on the moon around the jupiter more water , than in all the oceans , the combined .
and this place , this little on the moon around the jupiter , probably the first candidate for the presence of life on the moon or the body outside the earth , which we know .
an enormous and producing discovery .
our research in our solar system was taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
it may be that will allow us to respond to one of the most profound questions that you can ask , `` are we alone ? ''
is there any other applications research and science , other than the sense of wonder ?
yes , they have .
this is a very famous picture taken by , in fact , during my first рождественского сочельника , 24 , on december 1968 , when i was about eight months old .
it was taken аполлоном eight , when he flew on the other side of the moon .
of the earth , visible with аполлона eight .
a famous picture ; and a lot of people say , well , this is a picture of a year спасшая 1968 , which was quite worrying -- when i was a student churning in paris , the vietnam war .
and the reason is that people are thinking about this picture , like al gore that has spoken from the stage of ted , this photograph , probably , just the beginning of the movement for the environment .
because for the first time , we saw our world , not as a прочное , недвижимое and неразрушимое place , but as a quick , very хрупкий world , which is a черноте of space .
one of the things that 's me mention about exploring space program and the аполлон , '' which is the amount of you , derived from that .
i mean , they can all debate about what it was a great achievement , and what are the pictures came back as a result , but it takes a long , right ?
in fact , a lot of scientific research was written about the economic efficiency and economic impact programs `` аполлон . ''
the most much work was written by a company in 1975 , `` chase econometrics . ''
and she pointed out that for every one dollar spent by the program 14 dollars вернулось back into the u.s. economy .
so the program , аполлон '' самоокупилась , in вдохновении , in engineering achievements , and in вдохновении new scientists and engineers around четырнадцатикратно .
research could самоокупаться .
and at the expense scientific discovery ?
and at the expense of innovation ?
in this picture , i think it 's nothing .
in fact , it shows the range of hydrogen .
see , before the 1880-х and 1890-х many scientists and possibilities like to look at the light , излучаемый atoms .
and they have these very strange pictures here .
what you see , when the пропускаете in terms of light , испускаемый нагретым hydrogen , it 's not just lights up a white light , and it emits a specific color : red , светло-голубой , and a little bit тёмно-голубых .
this led to the atomic structures , it is that this is a атоме has the nucleus with электронами around .
and the electrons can be just a specific places .
when they перепрыгивают from place to place and back , they of light exact colors .
and the fact that the atoms in the нагревании of very specific colors , was the primary driver , which led to the development of quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms .
i just want to show this picture , because it deserves attention .
it 's a spectrum излучаемый from the sun .
this is a photograph of all the atoms in the atmosphere of the sun , поглощающие light .
опять-же , they suck up the lights are different colors , when the electrons bounce up and down , up and down .
and let 's look at some of those black in the spectrum of the ads .
so this is a helium , which was discovered just one of the light from the sun , because some of those black lanes sync with no one element , which known .
that 's why helium 's filled up with helium .
the greek `` гелиос '' -- the sun .
now , that sounds эзотерично , and , indeed , it was the esoteric search , but quantum theory quickly led to the idea of electrons in terms of materials , such as the silicon , for example .
and because the silicon has properties , we can actually do transistors , it 's purely quantum phenomenon .
and without that kind of science , движимой любопытством , understanding the fabric of an atom , which led to a эзотерической quantum theory and quantum mechanics , we would not be able to get transistors and so on кремниевые chips , and we would have not been базиса modern economy .
here 's another great , i think , поворот in this story .
in `` the solar system , '' we all the time подчёркивали the fact that the laws of physics have a universal signal .
one of the most amazing thing about the physics of knowledge and understanding of nature , which we get on earth is something that we can make them not only the level of the planets , but also the level of distant stars and galaxies .
the overwhelming predictions made out of quantum mechanics after observing строением atoms , the same theory , объясняющей transistors -- about this is that no one star in the universe , the достигшая of the end of my life , not more than sizes , in particular , 1.4 times the mass of the sun .
that 's it , mounted on a ton of stars .
you can make all the calculations into the lab on pieces of paper , to take the telescope , нацелить him in the sky , and you wo n't find any single dead stars , more than about полторы the mass of the sun .
that is to say , it 's a wonderful prediction .
so what 's going on with a star , based on the edge of the mass ?
this is what happens .
this is an image of galaxies , the ordinary galaxies , a содержащей like a hundred billion stars like our sun on .
this is one of the всего-лишь billion galaxies in the universe .
in the center of the galaxy , about a billion stars . that 's why it 's so bright lights up .
this galaxy удалена by about 50 million light years , the galaxy in the neighborhood .
but there is a bright star is one of the stars in the galaxy .
this is a star удалена for 50 million light years .
it 's part of the galaxy , and she bright lights up as well as the center of the galaxy with a billion stars in there .
it 's a kind of a supernova nearby 1a .
amazing phenomenon , because it 's a сдвоенная star .
it 's called кислородно-углеродный карлик .
she 's sitting there , let 's say one , three times the mass of the sun .
and it 's got компаньон , which goes around him , a big star , a massive gas balloon .
and that makes a star -- she перекачивает gas with my звезды-компаньона , until it gets to a similar limit чандрасекара , and then she взрывается .
it взрывается and shining as well as bright , and a billion stars , for two weeks , and gives off the universe is not only energy , but an enormous amount of chemicals .
but there was no carbon and oxygen at the big bang .
and the carbon and oxygen in the universe were n't during the first generation of stars .
and the carbon and oxygen were made in the same stars , запертые inside , and after возвращённые in a universe with such that 's explosions , and then the сгуститься in the planets , stars and new solar systems and , finally , in these people like us .
i think there 's a demo , the power of beauty and the universality of laws of physics , because we understand that process because of the fabric of atoms here on earth .
it 's найденная me a wonderful quote alexander 's флеминга , where he talks about интуитивном discovery , `` when i woke up just a little bit засветло 28 september 1928 , i 'm not going to turn the medical care , having discovered the world antibiotic . ''
researchers around the world atom that did n't intend to invent a transistor .
and they 're certainly not going to go to describe mechanics supernovae explosions , which in turn led us to the нахождению of anywhere in the universe was created by building the material of life .
and also , i think , then we can pick up the deepest ideas about our place in the universe , and about the value of our home planet .
this is a picture of our planet dramatic with you .
well , it does n't look like a picture of our planet .
it 's more like this picture of saturn , because that 's all it is .
it was taken by зондом cassini .
but this is famous for not because of beauty and the brilliance of saturn 's rings , and because of that little barely заметного пятнышка , висящего under one of the rings .
and if i увеличу image -- you can see it as well .
it looks like the moon , but in fact , this is a picture of the earth .
this is a picture of the earth in relation to each of saturn .
this is the view on our planet from a distance in one 1.2 billion miles away .
and i think that the earth is a strange property -- as you go from it , we are , the красивее she looks like .
but that 's not the most удалённая or a famous picture of our planet .
it was taken there 's this thing called a spacecraft , `` вояджер . ''
and this is a picture of me in front of it , so you can imagine the scale .
`` вояджер '' -- very small machine .
now he удалён from the earth by about 16 billion miles away , передавая signal using this plates and energy in 20 watts , and we still connected .
he went to jupiter , saturn , уран and нептун
and after the вояджер '' to all of those planets , carl sagan , one of my great heroes , i gave a great idea -- `` spin вояджер '' and take a picture of every planet that he received a visit .
and he took this picture of earth .
it 's very , very hard to see the earth . so . it 's called `` бледно-голубая dot . '' the earth подвешена in that red столбе light .
this is the earth , from a distance in six , four billion miles away .
and in closing , i 'm going to read you what sagan wrote about it , because i could n't find the words красивее to describe saw in that picture .
he said , `` see again , at this point .
this is here . this is our home . this is us .
all of our happiness and suffering , thousands of самоуверенных religions , идеологий and economic доктрин , each individual and собиратель , every hero , and трус , every созидатель and разрушитель civilizations , king of each and every one влюблённая крестьянин , a young couple , every mother and father , every did hope for every child , every and the inventor of the путешественник spiritual , every teacher , every politician продажный every `` superstar , every `` the supreme leader , every saint and грешник in the history of our species can live here -- in this пылинке , зависшей in the headlights sunlight .
i mean , somebody said that astronomy прививает humility and воспитывает character .
now , there is no better evidence of the stupidity of human тщеславия than this далёкий vision of our little around the world .
for me , it подчёркивает our obligation to be we 're kinder with each other , беречь and лелеять бледно-голубую point , which is the only home we 've ever known . ''
these words about the power of science and exploration .
and a lot of people often going and will take the strong , what do we know enough about the universe .
you could take this thing why 1920-х , and you did n't have to be penicillin .
you can do it in 1890-х , and you 're not would be a transistor .
and today , in his cause these heavy economic times .
`` of course we know enough .
we do n't need to discover anything new of our universe . ''
let me leave the last word for those who recently is getting my hero , хамфри davey , which was doing science at the end of the 19th century .
he 's had been нападкам in those days .
we know enough , at the end of the 19th century .
just use this knowledge , just make things .
he said this : `` nothing is more фатальным for of the human mind , the idea that we think about science окончательны that our триумфы behind that there is no longer mysteries of nature and what 's more , there 's no place for a new piece that will open . ''
thank you .
so , imagine you 're standing on a street from elsewhere in africa , and to you японец comes up and said , `` i 'm sorry , as it 's called the neighborhood ? ''
and you say , `` i 'm sorry , it 's a дубовая of the street , and it 's вязовая .
it 's 26-ая , and it 's 27-ая . ''
he says , `` ok , but what 's called the neighborhood ? ''
you say , `` well , does not blocks have names .
there 's the names of the streets , and the side is just nameless space between the streets . ''
and he goes , a little bit of a замешательстве and расстройстве .
now imagine you 're standing on a street in japan , and treat right next to the person , and you say , `` excuse me , what 's called the street ? ''
you say , `` hmm , well , it 's a 17-ый block , and it 's 16 . ''
you can say , i learned , but what 's called this street ? ''
and you hear the answer : `` well , there 's no streets names .
there 's a blocks have names .
they had all have names . and the streets -- it 's just nameless space between кварталами .
and then you 're like , `` okay , so how do you then is the error of a home address ? ''
he says , `` easy , here 's the eighth neighborhood .
it 's a 17-ый quarter , is a house number one . ''
you say , `` okay . but when i прогуливался here , i noticed that the number of houses are not in order . ''
and he said , `` well , of course , not in order . they go in the order that were built .
the house that was built in the neighborhood in the first -- this is the first house .
the second one was built a house , number two .
the third one is a house number three . it 's easy . obviously . ''
i love that sometimes we need to be on the other side of the world , to discover their own допущения , about the existence of whom have themselves , we did n't know , and realize that the opposite direction , it may also be true .
so , for example , in china , there are doctors who believe in what their job is to you were здороы .
and in every month , when you 're healthy , you pay them , but when you get sick , you 're not , because they do n't survive with my work . they become richer , when you 're healthy , rather than when you 're sick .
in music , most of us believe to be the `` one '' as the downbeat , the beginning of the music any phrase . one , two , three , four .
but in западноафриканской music '' times '' is a phrase , like the end point at the end of the sentences .
can you hear that not only the building the phrase , and and in the way they count music , two , three , four , time .
and this is a map is also true .
there are saying about what the truth , which one would you have thought about india , the opposite is also true .
and let 's not forget about being at ted where or whatever , which would be really great ideas or you 've heard , or the reverse may also be true .
domo arigato gozaimashita .
pat митчелл : tell me about this брошке .
мадлен олбрайт : it 's wrecked '' glass ceiling . ''
pm : oh .
and i think that 's a good choice , i would say , for tedwomen .
ma : in the morning , when i встаю , i трачу a lot of time trying to conceive of today , what would happen .
no брошей not would be , if not a saddam hussein .
i 'm going to tell you , as it did .
i went to the u.n. ambassador . it was after the war персидском in the gulf of mexico , and i was a проинструктированным послом .
by fire has been achieved through a series of sanctions , and i had an instruction kept talking perfectly horrible things about саддаме хусейне , where he is , of course , заслуживал -- because it 's invaded in the country .
and all of a sudden in the paper inside the baghdad gained a poem , which to me with only than any сравнивали , but above all , i call an unparalleled serpent .
