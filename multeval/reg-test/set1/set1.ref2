indonesia cancels sale of famous british environment-friendly bag amid fears of chaotic snaring
indonesia has cancelled sale of a famous british environment-friendly bag due to the chaos caused by the snaring wave in hong kong earlier this month , said its dealer today .
" we cancelled the launch of the environment-friendly bag due to what happened in hong kong , " said the director of the famous on pedder store in upscale plaza indonesia .
" it 's not worth it any more if people fight over a 140,000-rupiah ( about 494 nt dollars ) bag . "
thousands of hong kong people gathered outside the shops on the 6th to snare the limited-edition environment-friendly bag designed by british designer anya hindmarch , which carries " i am not a plastic bag . " however , since the shops refused to open their doors , the situation went out of control .
the designer product that advocates environmental protection was designed to replace plastic bags . it , however , unexpectedly became an overnight fashion indicator in london and new york and sparked snaring , selling on the online auction website , ebay , for many times its retail price .
on pedder , the only authorized dealer in indonesia , said it was unsure whether it would put the bag on sale in a few days .
south korea holds direct talks with taliban amid hostage crisis countdown
afghan taliban has kidnapped 23 south korean hostages and set today 's sunset as the deadline for withdrawal of south korean troops from afghanistan , or they will kill the hostages .
as the clock ticks away , the situation is showing positive development , with south korean officials holding their first talks with the taliban today .
however , the taliban said at the same time that another german hostage abducted was very weak and was in a coma and losing consciousness .
the taliban has called for germany and south korea to pull their troops out of afghanistan and demanded an exchange of these hostages for the 33 guerrillas held prisoner by the afghan government .
" we've established contact directly with south korean delegates through tribal elders , " said the taliban spokesman ahmadi from an unknown location in a telephone interview with afp .
" we hope this time the talks can yield a result , " said ahmadi .
the taliban has set a deadline at dusk local time ( 10:30pm taiwan time ) , after which they will start killing the south koreans hostages .
the guerrillas have already extended the deadline twice .
military talks between two koreas end in discord amid disagreement on sea disputes
the three-day high-level military talks between south and north korea ended in discord today due to divergence over delimitation of sea border .
" we've come to a conclusion that we don't need these fruitless talks any more , " said north korea 's chief delegate lieutenant-general kim yong-chol as the talks at the border city of panmunjom went into the last day 's agenda today .
a red-faced and apparently angry kim yong-chol attacked south korea for intentionally avoiding delimitation of a new maritime border to replace the existing northern limit line .
he said the " northern limit line " was not legal .
the northern limit line in the yellow sea was drawn up by the us forces in 1953 in the wake of the korean war . however , it has become the focus of disputes between the two koreas in recent years . even worse , north korea refuses to recognize it .
north korea says south korean warships have fueled tensions by violating the waters illegally , while south korea rejects the accusation as groundless .
a clash in the water area in june 1999 killed dozens of north korean sailors .
another similar clash was reported in june 2002 , in which six south koreans were unfortunately killed .
us treasury secretary arrives in china for a visit with environment and exchange rate as focus
us treasury secretary paulson arrived in china yesterday for a visit , as the us was trying its best to convince china to further carry out necessary economic reforms and environmental protection efforts , especially the issue of rmb exchange rate that receives wide attention .
us diplomats said paulson was first headed to xining , the capital of the vast northwestern province of qinghai .
china is currently implementing a series of environmental protection initiatives near the largest salt-water lake in qinghai province .
paulson left for beijing today to discuss with chinese officials in charge topics such as promotion of the us-china strategic economic dialogue launched last year .
the us-china strategic economic dialogue mainly covers economic , environmental and other issues , but the one at the forefront is the exchange rate of rmb , which is seen by lawmakers in the united states as significantly undervalued .
there has been growing pressure within the us as the us trade deficit with china soars . us lawmakers plan to take retaliatory actions to fight against what they call unfair trade policies of china .
last week the us senate finance committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the treasury to identify nations with " fundamentally misaligned " currencies , potentially opening the door to economic sanctions against beijing .
us lawmakers say the undervalued rmb makes us-bound goods from china extremely cheap , thereby exacerbating trade imbalance between the us and china , with the us trade deficit with china hitting 232.5 billion us dollars last year .

experts : insurance qdii not draining cash from domestic stock market anytime soon
july 30 chinanews.com
according to a report in the china securities , with the introduction of the interim regulations governing overseas investment of insurance capitals the other day , insurance capitals have broader room to take advantage of the capital market .
liu lefei , chief investment officer of china life co. , ltd , believes that due to the appreciation of rmb and promising domestic capital market , insurance institutions will not invest overseas by buying foreign currencies on a large scale in the short run , which means insurance qdii will not drain cash from the domestic stock market anytime soon .
the report says quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts say in the absence of a derivatives market for rmb , insurance institutions lack sufficient hedging measures . it is therefore not yet time to buy foreign currencies on a large scale .
liu lefei said that in the long run , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should have some weight in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , given the fairly large upward pressure of rmb at present , china life will primarily use its own foreign reserves for overseas investment .
as for investing overseas by buying foreign currencies , caution should be taken under the current circumstances .

bian critically alludes to judicial intervention in elections taiwan " judicial yuan " denies and demands his explanation
july 31 chinanews.com - chen shui-bian on the 30th questioned the island 's judicial personnel for intervention into the leadership elections of the taiwan region .
kao chin-chih , " director-general of the department of judicial administration at the judicial yuan " of taiwan said on the same day that the current behaviors of judges on the island were inconsistent with what chen shui-bian said , and he demanded that chen shui-bian explain his comments .
according to a report in taiwan 's united daily , chen shui-bian on the 30th questioned judges , prosecutors and investigators for intervening , influencing or even attempting to manipulate election campaigns of candidates from different parties out of political factors or election considerations and said he hoped the phenomenon did not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui-bian's questioning , president of taiwan " judicial yuan " weng yueh-sheng kept a low key with no responses , while " secretary-general " fan kuang-chun appointed kao chin-chih to speak on behalf of the " judicial yuan . "
kao chin-chih said both the fundamental law of taiwan and " judges code of conduct " state explicitly that judges should stay beyond parties and must not participate in party activities or assist with election campaigns ; all judges have carefully observed relevant restrictions and the " judicial yuan " believes all judges are behaving very well .
kao chin-chih noted by giving an example , when judge jang shenq-shii of kaohsiung " branch high court " attended a program at the ketagalan institute several years ago , he was immediately decided to be punished by the self-regulation panel comprised of judges due to the partisan tint of relevant courses .
jang shenq-shii once wanted to run in the primary for the progressive party but eventually decided to quit , again amid controversy over his participation while in office .
kao chin-chih believes if it is the trial of an individual case , there is recourse to the appeal process . one should not infer the judge has ulterior political motives solely based on the result of the ruling .

reports of organizations such as the confederation of german employers ' associations and the german engineers association show that there is a fairly large shortage of engineers and professional technicians in the current german labor market .
according to statistics of the german federal labor agency , in may this year , the shortage of supply was 12,700 for engineers and 9,600 for technicians in the german labor market .
germany has set relatively high threshold of attracting foreign talents in order to protect employment of its citizens .
under germany 's immigration law , professional talents from non-eu countries cannot get work and resident permits unless their annual income in germany is no lower than 85,500 euros .
schavan suggests lowering the threshold to 40,000 to 60,000 euros .
don't worship legal " theorists " blindly
it is stipulated in article 8 of the draft amendment to the attorneys law recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for review that those who apply for practicing as an attorney and have senior professional designations or equivalent professional levels from previous professional work such as legal research and teaching , can be permitted to practice as a lawyer upon approval of the justice department of the state council .
( june 28 , china youth daily )
there are " theorists " and " practitioners " in law , where the former primarily involve " abstract behaviors " such as legal teaching and research , while the latter are more of " concrete behaviors " such as litigations , legal counseling and legal services .
for a long time , there has been mutual contempt between legal " theorists " and " practitioners . " " theorists " think " practitioners " are merely mechanical " legal dogmatists " lacking necessary attainments in the science of law , while criticisms of " practitioners " about " theorists " are directed at the " inability of theories to guide practice . "
given such gap in the division of labor , what law can do is to remain neutral rather than strongly support either of the two .
however , the " chartered attorney system " in the attorneys law recognizes the opinion factually that legal " theorists " are superior to legal " practitioners . "
in reality , for some experts and scholars who study and teach pure legal theories such as the legal history and international law , no matter how profound and sophisticated their theories are , they are incompatible with legal practice .
thus , the " chartered attorney system " has undoubtedly created a " bad opening " to confusions in legal " practitioner " qualifications , which has extremely adverse influence .
blind worship of " theorists " does not stop here . phenomena where reports of expert opinions and expert argumentation seminars often affect and even override court verdicts are also direct reflections of such blind worship .

don't let peddlers disturb public places
traveling away from home , the aim is to be relaxed , refreshed and comfortable and to enjoy natural scenery and the achievements of social civilization to the maximum extent .
however , when traveling domestically , many people have experienced such annoyance , which is being blocked in public places by peddlers and those doing agent businesses .
no matter in a bus or a train , they are always persistently harassed by peddlers and illegal agents whenever getting on or off the vehicle .
if they are not selling eggs , peanuts or pies , then they are selling newspapers or magazines . others are a large number of illegal agents who recommend restaurants or accommodations , or even peddle fake invoices .
if you don't accept , they may follow you several hundred meters , quite an air of i would rather die if i don't succeed .
at some scenic spots , many tourists feel the same way .
before you even enter the gate , there will be someone peddling things like tourist souvenirs and small crafts .
once you enter , there will be even more such things . even the best mood will be dispelled .
a media agency once reported that while many foreign tourists to xi'an were amazed by the famous and historic sites in xi'an , they felt perplexed by piles of vendors and peddlers selling goods everywhere .
public places like bus stops and scenic spots are supposed to be places for traveling and relaxing , where courtesy , order , quietness and harmony should prevail , so as to give tourists a comfortable and easy environment .
free entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb tourists ' moods , but also virtually destruct the public order at these public places , thus creating visual pollution and environmental pollution . in addition , it also provides conditions and opportunities for lawbreakers to stir up troubles .
what 's important is that these public places are the window showcasing local cultural and ideological progress . seeing a spot reveals the whole picture . what is damaged is not only a question of image , but it will also affect local economic development .
just imagine , you want to make your tourism industry big and strong , but use such messy tourist environment to greet guests from around the world . who will want to come , and who will dare to come ?
then , how does your tourism economy yield any benefits ?
with the high season coming for tourism , it should be a priority to create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from all over the world .
public places are not markets . business activities of vendors and peddlers should be regulated . those who operate without a license should be firmly removed , and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed .
only a civilized and orderly environment will make tourists come , go and return gladly .
in a nutshell , don't let peddlers disturb public places .
" incentive on opting out of minimum living standard scheme " cannot stand up to scrutiny
by giving away things like refrigerators , the jianguomen subdistrict of beijing 's dongcheng district has awarded 12 households enjoying the minimum living allowance for opting out of the minimum living standard scheme .
( the beijing news - july 10 )
the author is happy for these households for the improvement in their living , but has mixed feelings towards the term " opting out of the minimum living standard scheme " and the practice of " awarding . "
" regarding problems such as cheating on the minimum living allowance , encouraging people to opt out of the minimum living standard scheme is to set examples for other households enjoying the minimum living allowances , " deputy director at the jianguomen subdistrict office said .
such examples are indeed worth promoting if they are to encourage other people enjoying the minimum living allowance to get out of difficulties through their own efforts ; they are , however , a bit naive if the purpose is to " move " those who have cheated on the minimum living allowance for long .
in distinguishing between and cleaning up real and fake households entitled to the minimum living allowance , what should be relied on more is the law .
competent authorities should highlight the obligations of households entitled to the minimum living allowance while they enjoy the minimum living standard allowance : for example , informing of changes in family members and income in a timely manner , reporting the employment situation , undergoing regular reviews etc. and competent authorities should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , " withdrawal from the minimum living standard scheme pursuant to law " is the permanent solution .
who will pay for the in-kind rewards given by the subdistrict to the households who opt out of the minimum living standard scheme ?
as a level of governmental organizations , the spending of a subdistrict is covered by fiscal allocation .
yet should this money of the taxpayers be spent ?
on the one hand , by opting out of the minimum living standard scheme , the households prove to have certain capacity to " sustain themselves ; " on the other hand , aren't there still people claiming the minimum living standard allowance ?
the government 's fiscal allocation that is dubbed life-saving money should provide timely assistance rather than add icing to a cake .
remark that liu gangyi is willing to be a servant is more credible
on july 10 , liu gangyi , party committee secretary of mulan township in xindu district , chengdu , who is the country 's first publicly nominated and directly elected township party committee secretary , had his fourth democratic assessment after taking office and achieved a satisfaction rate of 97 % .
in the reporter 's conversation with liu gangyi , liu gangyi positioned himself as a " servant . "
( the beijing news - a day ago )
the " servant " uttered by liu gangyi may be more real and convincing than the " servant " uttered by those appointed officials .
the biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election , compared with the mechanism of appointment , is that with the former , the source of authority is primarily decided by average party members and commoners , while the latter are appointed by a higher organizational level . and the direction of the source of authority determines the former must place their responsibility for the public at the top .
the source of authority and who to report to are the fundamental factors that decide how the elected go about their work .
some people question such " democratic assessment , " saying it is more like a " show of democracy . "
my view is that it is better to have this form of " democratic assessment " than nothing .
considering the history and current situation of the grassroot democracy progress in china , i believe public nomination and direct election are already a major breakthrough . as an important part of this innovation , democratic assessment should not be underestimated in advancing the grassroot democracy progress .
india poised to elect first female president . analyst say there is a good chance of being elected ; female voters hope she can boost the standing for women .
on june 23 , patil put her palms together before filling out the documents for presidential candidates .
indian presidential election began on the 19th , with the new president to be chosen from the incumbent vice-president shekhawat and rajasthan governor pratibha patil who recently resigned .
patil is the first female presidential candidate in india 's history , who could become india 's first ever female president if elected .
patil is the nominee of the ruling national congress party , while shekhawat is from the opposition bharatiya janata party .
since the national congress party dominates the electoral college for the president , both the media and the general public guess patil has a higher possibility of being elected .
patil , 72 , was the female governor of the state of rajasthan .
originally a lawyer , she made her way into the congress in 1985 . experienced in politics , she received good reviews from the government while serving as rajasthan governor .
also committed to social welfare , she is the honorary chairperson of many cultural , educational and social welfare organizations .
analysts say patil was selected as a candidate for her unswerving loyalty to sonia gandhi , chairperson of the india national congress party .
in india , the gandhi family has controlled the ruling national congress party for a long time .
patil is supported by a great number of female voters , who believe that patil would rebuild their image and boost their standing in india , where the concept of discrimination against women is serious .
under the constitution , india is a federal country , where the president is the nominal chief of state and commander of the armed forces , more of a symbol than representing any parties or organizations .

climate change leads to rapid shrink of alpine glaciers
geneva , july 29 , by the newspaper ( reporter liu jun )
glaciologists at the swiss academy of sciences found through long-term follow-up studies that the over 1,800 glaciers in switzerland were shrinking at an average rate of 3 percent a year between 1850 and 2005 .
the 2003 heatwave alone caused 1.8 percent of alpine glaciers to melt .
experts believe if global temperature rises by 3 degrees by 2100 , the glaciers will shrink by 80 percent as compared with today ; a rise of 5 degrees , the glaciers will totally disappear .
the aletsch glacier , the longest glacier in europe , is listed in the unesco world heritage sites . but it lost 100m in the year between 2005 and 2006 alone . protecting natural environment has developed to such an extent that allows no delay .

russian security service charges exiled oligarch with " coup plot "
borovkov , lawyer of the russian oligarch berezovsky exiled in london , said on july 2 that the russian fsb has formally filed a new charge against his client , accusing berezovsky of " conspiring to plot a coup against the state and attempting to seize russian political power by violence . "
in an interview with a reporter of britain 's the guardian in april this year , berezovsky declared he was preparing to mount a " palace coup " in russia , confirming he was providing financial assistance to representatives of the right-wing elites who were against the government policy , borovkov noted .
the russian fsb 's investigation bureau immediately began criminal investigation in berezovsky in compliance with article 278 , violent seizure of power , of the criminal code of the russian federation and formally filed applicable charges to the savelovsky court in moscow in recent days .
it is learned that in february 2006 , the office of the russian persecutor general had filed criminal charges against berezovsky , on the same ground that the exiled oligarch confirmed his attempt to obtain russian political power by force .
as berezovsky had been in exile abroad and could not be extradited , russia halted probing of the case temporarily in january 2007 .
the savelovsky court initiated another criminal case against the exiled oligarch , in which the office of the russian persecutor general accused berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214 million rubles from a russian airway and laundering 16 million rubles . after hearings , the court has decided to postpone court probing until july 12 and will appoint a state defense attorney for the defendant during this time .
berezovsky thought all these were " a farce " and clearly forbade his defense attorneys to participate in court trials .

reports of diabetes drug avandia causing adverse reactions increase significantly
according to a us media report on the 15th , there has recently been a tendency of significant increase in the number of adverse reaction reports , such as cardiac diseases , caused by the anti-diabetes drug avandia in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , advising diabetes patients to take avandia with caution , because scientists issued a study report in an edition of the new england journal of medicine published on may 21 , saying the best-selling drug would significantly increase the rates of heart attack and death in patients .
the safety of avandia has thus been closely watched by doctors and patients .
according to statistics , within roughly a month after the safety warning , the us fda received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by avandia , 38 of which are death reports .
yet the fda only received 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively in january and february this year .
the adverse reactions were as minor as blisters and as serious as sudden death due to heart attack .
however , drug experts at the us fda believe it is yet too early to conclude that avandia is unsafe .
the fda is going to hold a hearing regarding the safety of avandia on july 30 .
avandia , introduced in 1999 , is an insulin sensitizer for treating type ii diabetes .
some six million diabetes patients around the world has taken or is taking avandia .
the manufacturer of avandia , the uk company glaxosmithkline , has believed avandia is safe and is " more beneficial than harmful " to patients .

us pentagon rethinks plan to cut us troops in europe
a us defense department official said on the 23rd that the us pentagon is reconsidering a 2002 plan to cut us troops stationed in europe by about half because of the war in iraq and changes in the world situation .
with the ongoing iraq war and worsened us relations with russia and iran , the pentagon leadership has questioned the feasibility of the plan to slash troops stationed in europe , the us media said , quoting a defense department official .
in 2002 , the then defense secretary rumsfeld announced the us would reduce troops in europe from 113,000 to 71,000 by 2012 , in order to create a " lean and effective " new force .
total us troops stationed in europe have decreased to 100,000 so far .
however , craddock , commander of the us european command , submitted a report to current defense secretary gates in june this year , in which he questioned the aforesaid reduction plan .
the report says the slash of us troops stationed in europe is accompanied by rotational transfer of many forces to iraq and afghanistan for battles , which leads to a shortage of us military personnel stationed in europe , such that they are unable to conduct regular cooperation with european allies .
the report recommends halting the plan to cut us troops in europe .
experts in the us believe the phenomenon above indicates that the iraq war has been such a long drag that it has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the us military .

three major functions of modern military uniforms
first is the identifying function ,
an important symbol to distinguish among armies of different nations , among different armed services , and between troops and civilians .
although the purposes of military uniforms are basically the same in the armed forces of some 100 nations big or small around the world , no armed forces of any two nations have identical military uniforms .
second is the symbolizing function .
to some extent , military uniforms not only reflect a country 's vitality and national characteristics , but also centrally showcases the combating capabilities and servicemen qualities of a country 's armed forces .
of the three major categories of military uniforms , dress uniforms , service uniforms and combat & training uniforms , nothing is more able to fully demonstrate the might of a country and its military than the neat and elegant dress uniforms .
third is the protective function .
with the rapid development of new and high-tech weapons , it has become a paramount issue in the development of military uniforms to improve the comprehensive protective performance of new combat & training uniforms , so that military uniforms have various functions , such as protecting from bullets , reconnaissance , chemistry , bacteria and radiation , as well as conditioning the temperature , humidity and air .

the party committee office of a battalion dare to get serious in handling thorny problems
chengdu , july 3 , by the newspaper
by qu yimao and yang ruiyu : " the fact that we can live in an apartment is attributed to the determination and resolution of the battalion 's party committee office to vacate houses . "
today , more than ten cadres of a communications training battalion at the chengdu military region who moved into apartments were all lit up with pleasure , as they were filled with admiration and gratitude for the working style of the " team " at the battalion 's party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges when tackling thorny problems .
a few years earlier , with staff changing and being replaced , some homes in the battalion 's family dormitory building were over-occupied in violation of rules , which brought housing difficulties to cadres on active service . both officers and soldiers are quite unhappy over it .
the battalion had tried to vacate the homes several times , but left it unsettled because of various resistance , making this problem a hard nut to crack .
" so long as we dare to get serious and are reasonable , there are no difficult problems that we can't solve . "
once the new party committee reached the consensus , principal leaders went out personally to begin a thorough cleanup regarding the problem of irregular housing occupation .
they touched people sentimentally and enlightened them sensibly on the one hand , hoping that those involved could put the overall situation into perspective ; on the other hand , they clarified applicable policies and rules of the troops about apartments , pool funded housing and economically affordable housing , expressing the resolute determination and fundamental stance of the party committee .
for those people who had housing elsewhere , but were reluctant to return the over-occupied housing , the party committee office made timely contact with their units and took necessary measures to urge them give cooperation to the troops ' work on voluntary basis .
after two months of attentive efforts , all tenants in the barrack complex who over-occupied housing in violation of rules moved out on schedule , and the battalion 's cadres on active service were all allocated housing in compliance with policies .
the working style of the battalion 's party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges also had chain effects , in that several cadres who were previously reluctant to give active cooperation in the organization 's allocation have now said they would follow the organization 's decisions .

jingjiang department of people 's armed force creates platform to boost quality of armed force cadres
by cao jiawei and zhu chunbin , pla daily : on june 18 , at an intensive training program for armed force cadres in the city of jingjiang , jiangsu province , the lecture win the psychological warfare in the context of informationization by lu yuqing , director of the xilai town department of people 's armed force , received positive comments amongst all participants .
this was a fresh change as a result of the city 's department of people 's armed force loading burdens onto armed force cadres and working to boost the overall quality of armed force cadres in line with the reality of different posts .
at the beginning of this year , when doing grassroot research , the party committee of the department of people 's armed force found that some armed force cadres did not focus on doing work related to the armed forces due to long years of service and multiple duties .
therefore , they have conducted training regularly for armed force cadres using such methods such as intensive training , meeting as a way of training , relying on local party school to provide training , with a view to address problems such as narrow knowledge spectrum and lack of versatile work skills .
in line with the core responsibilities , it has assigned tasks and loaded burdens onto armed force cadres boldly to improve their competency through on-the-job practice .
in addition , by actively coordinating with local organization departments , they jointly formulated the scheme of position competitions amongst armed force cadres , which explicitly requires head of an armed force department to be on the party committee of the same level without concurrently assuming other jobs ;
and set up an adjustment and exchange mechanism for armed force cadres , whereby some armed force cadres who are older or not suitable for grassroot armed force positions are adjusted or exchanged in a timely fashion , while comrades with good overall quality and high competency are promoted .
recently , chen yisong , a clerk of the armed force department at the new century shipbuilding co. , ltd. , who led a militia technical unit to fill a void of the nation with their innovatively developed underwater ship welding technique , was promoted to the company 's head of armed force department as an exception to the rule .
a good start calls for a good ending
solely from the result of the game , a score of 2-2 is reasonable and also acceptable to the chinese team . what 's essential is the process of the game , which is somewhat disappointing .
if it was the iranian team who led 2-0 before the chinese team equalized the score , this would definitely give chinese soccer fans different feelings and significantly boost morale . unfortunately , things were just the opposite .
a good start without a good ending could be said a chronic problem of the chinese team .
the chinese team often does not know how to play soccer under favorable circumstances . the conventional view is that chinese players have less than satisfactory psychological quality .
this is indeed a reason why the chinese team could not have a " good ending . "
however , seen from today 's game of the chinese team , it seems this is not completely true .
people like li weifeng are experienced veteran players , let alone people like sun jihai , sun xiang , shao jiayi and zheng zhi who have played soccer in europe . they have broad experience and knowledge , and should not have problematic psychological quality logically speaking .
the chinese team was unfortunately forced into a draw by the iranian team this time , most probably because of improper deployment of players .
the iranian team substituted with two people while trailing behind and the situation improved instantly .
the chinese team also substituted with three players , but the result was not good .
to overcome the problem of having a good start without a good ending , the source of the problem must be spotted .
as long as the problem is spotted , it may not be difficult to find a solution to redress the problem .
what we fear is to see a doctor indiscriminately in case of an emergency disease .
if things go on like that , the chronic problem will persist no matter how many games the chinese team plays , not to mention a step forward in each game that people expect .

" sdrd " education collaboration areas launched in saf base
by xue bingjian and reporter xu yeqing , pla daily : the phenomenon where education at small , dispersed , remote and direct ( sdrd ) units is hard to organize , lacking in resources and individually carried out will be history in a base of the second artillery force .
the reporters learned recently that after a six-month pilot project , the base handed down steps to implement " ideological and political education outline " and several ideological and political education collaboration areas that cover all its sdrd units have officially begun operation .
to promote effective implementation of the ideological and political education outline , the base organized efforts to perform in-depth investigation and research into the status of ideological and political education at sdrd units early this year and sorted out key problems that affected and constrained the time , people and effects of the education , creating the new education pattern of collaboration areas for sdrd units .
the specific practice of the collaboration areas is to break the bound of units and in an area where the sdrd units are relatively concentrated , designate a brigade or regiment level unit as the coordinator , which will conduct centralized planning of theme education . units of different relationships of subordination and affiliation attend lectures together at a close location or hold remote discussions with video systems .
education capabilities are centrally allocated by way of rotational lectures in conjunction with position competitions ; education hardware within a area is used in a coordinated manner , information and data , as well as experience in education of each unit are shared and exchanged , report tours about typical examples in an area are organized regularly , and officers and soldiers discuss what they have learned from study .
each collaboration area has put in place a full-time education contact and a part-time education information collector .
building on this , the collaboration areas also established systems of seeking help with hard problems , joint consultations on major educational topics , emergency briefing of ideological situations , and that of assessment and evaluation .
zhang shengmin , director of the base 's political department , told the reporters that establishing the political education collaboration areas has not only minimized waste of educational resources , but also deepened the effects of education .
some political instructors voluntarily learn new knowledge and seek new methods of education for fear of losing marks in front of officers and soldiers from other units .
officers and soldiers receiving education also digest what is taught , for fear of saying anything unprofessional in front of officers and soldiers from friendly and neighboring units during discussion and analysis .
as such , passions of the educators and the educated are both effectively inspired .

" if in four to six weeks after copa america i'm still unable to secure a contract for one or two seasons in a high-level league club , then retirement may not be a bad choice for me .
" with monchengladbach relegated to germany 's second division , keller left the team for which he played for more than two seasons .

the next match against the colombian team may well be the last performance of the us team and keller in this year 's copa america .

rio de janeiro , july 21 , xinhua ( reporters chen weihua , leng tong )
the cuban delegation complained on the 21st that the boxing ring ropes were so too at this year 's pan-american games and would influence the performance of boxers .
according to rules of the international boxing association , box ring ropes should be 6.1 meters long for international competitions . but , as measured by pedro roque , coach of the cuban delegation 's boxing team , the boxing ring ropes were more than one meter shorter than the standard at this year 's pan-american games .
roque said , " we lodged an official protest , because this matter not only affects the one country of cuba , but also involves everyone .
too short ropes will affect boxers ' shunning moves . "
" if no ropes can be found in rio that meet the olympic standard , it can be found elsewhere , " he also joked .
" if we knew beforehand , we would have brought them from cuba . "
the mexican and colombian delegations also expressed dissatisfaction on the day with the length of boxing ring ropes .
despite his victory in the first game , colombian boxer julio deibis said , " although i won the first game , the boxing ring was so narrow that it really made me feel uncomfortable . "

ccdi , i worry about the effect of your " anti-corruption deadline "
[ old confused monk ] posted at 2007-07-02 14:41:10 [ send text message ] [ tabular menu ]
on may 30 , ccdi set a one-month deadline for corrupt elements throughout the country . if they fail to voluntarily confess within this deadline , until june 30 , they will be arrested .
the humble commoner that i am , on hearing that , i couldn't help laughing ; when catching thieves , the police inform the thieves one month in advance , hurry and confess voluntarily or you will be arrested ; throughout the world , where is corruption fought like this ?
doesn't this amount to openly informing corrupt officials to hurry and run , to hurry and remove criminal evidence ?
what is the point ?
wouldn't it be .. well , there is no way to explain .
however , even if it works , how effective will it be ?
can it restrain and frighten corrupt officials ?
we don't rule out that there will be timid ones among them who will voluntarily confess . but won't there be more of them fleeing ?
let 's not mention whether the results are significant now that the ccdi 's anti-corruption deadline is approaching , but it did work in another way .
that is to say , corrupt officials all over all tacitly understood , were secretly delighted . they will all be grateful to the ccdi .
with a period of one month , there is enough time to hurry and transfer assets .
if i were a corrupt official , i would certainly have this interpretation , and i definitely wouldn't go to you and voluntarily declare anything .
corrupt officials ' extreme rejoicing will be expressed like this : " haha , thanks .. "
common people are truly confused . what is going on with the anti-corruption campaign ? why is it so hard to have a vigorous attitude , to be determined in taking action ?
how effective will this kind of corruption fighting be ?
in conclusion , ccdi , i worry about the effect of your " anti-corruption deadline . "
no privatization of land is the bottom line for my heart 's ease

no privatization of land is the bottom line for my heart 's ease
i don't think i am someone easily angered , at least i feel this way .
i have always been rational and even-tempered when expressing myself on the forum , very rarely losing reason , talking nonsense .
and i have constantly maintained strong faith and ardent expectations for the central leadership of the party . no matter how inconsistent reform measures are with my ideas , i can accept these as a " characteristic . "
but if , once land starts being privatized ( or privatization in disguised form ) , then all of this will lose its basis for existence .
lose a thousand soldiers before losing an inch of land . national land resources are the largest social resource .
working people and national land resources are the roots of a state .
as long as the nature of national land resources is unchanged , this nation 's character will not be easily changed . once the nature of national land resources changes , then virtually everything changes .
i'm not a cpc member , but i remember clearly that i once pledged as follows : " love the country , love the people , study hard , and train well , preparing to : dedicate my strength to the communist cause ! "
" study diligently ; work energetically , and bear hardships before enjoying life . strive for the communist cause ! "
people like me who once pledged this and once sang " we are the successors of socialism , " if you are still not shameless enough , then you should bear in mind your own pledge from before .
if you have betrayed your pledge , please honestly stand up and walk away from " communism . " don't cheat the masses by holding on to this sign on the one hand , while on the other hand calculating how to sell this sign at a good price .
of course , i hope all these worries are needless and , hope that i can maintain rationality and calmness forever .
bear in mind that " we are the successors of socialism . "
what if there is nothing to take over ?
one generation of people , two eras of experience
recently someone posed a question : are there any mao loyalists among 30-year-olds ?
later , the age was changed to 20 .
actually , the people of this age group never experienced the mao zedong era . i +wonder if the one who posed this question suffers from a brain malfunction , or a congenital brain defect .
in cities , the most qualified voices about the mao zedong era should be those who personally experienced that time , those who suffered much during +that time , that is , those who were born during the period from 1950-1960 .
after they were born , their parents participated in political activities and were unable to provide equivalent love to their children .
just when they needed nourishment , there was a three-year natural disaster , with much suffering from hunger .
as they began school , they ran into the cultural revolution , wasting several years of study .
some even quit school for good . from 15-17 years of age , without having finished school , they were forced to give up school and respond to the party 's call to go up into the mountains and down into the villages , to support frontier areas .
after they went to work , they regarded the working class as the most honorable , voluntarily choosing the dirtiest and most tiring work .
glory for a time , worthless for life .
when it was time to get married , it was from them that late marriage , late childbirth , and only one child started .
+when it should have been time for a pay +raise , enterprises required diplomas . they couldn't get pay +raises without a diploma .
they worked laboriously to raise their children , supporting them through basic education . when their children were admitted to universities , they ran into the double whammy of education system reform and state-owned enterprise reform , facing tuition increases and unemployment .
growing older day by day , they started getting sick , and were sadly caught up in medical system reform . unable to afford medical fees , their illnesses were denied medical treatment .
as can be seen , all of society 's unfairness unsparingly befell this generation of theirs .
but among these people , few oppose mao zedong , attack mao zedong .
why ?
they were not mao zedong 's minions . they had flesh and blood , with their actual lives within the realm of human relations in our society . they personally experienced the history of going up into the mountains and down to the villages , to unemployment , confronting the social phenomena of both eras .
though they were greatly discontented with , even harboring hatred toward wasted education , hunger , cold , and some negative social phenomena of the mao zedong era , yet : in the view of national spirit , the morality of human relations , and the temperament of society , they still regard the mao zedong era as a good one .
the parents of some cyber-friends belong to this generation . you can chat with them .

" injected watermelons , " " cancer-causing bananas , " and " cardboard-filled buns "
[ by wasteland beyond the great wall ] posted at 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [ send text message ] [ tabular menu ] i remember in the year before last , it was reported that some people had used syringes to inject chemicals into hainan watermelons . as a result , a large batch of watermelons rotted in the field in hainan , and large numbers of watermelon peasants lost money .
cctv later did a follow-up report . it turned out this incident had never happened at all .
this news report sounded weird from the beginning because using syringes to inject chemicals into individual big watermelons not only lacked practical sense , but also was impossible to do in terms of the workload .
i can recall an even more vivid memory from last year . certain news media reported that banana trees in hainan were infected with a disease similar to human cancer , and that infected banana trees were going to die for sure .
as a result , many people mistakenly thought that you could catch cancer by eating bananas . the result was the same , the price of hainan bananas dropped sharply , causing banana farmers to be beyond grief , to pour out endless grievances .
the two above mentioned news reports both caused a sensational effect , in that they directly touched the most sensitive of people 's nerves , that is , food safety issues .
if the news media claims that certain food threatens people 's health , then the news is certain to travel quickly . as for the subjects involved , people 's general attitude is : better to be safe than sorry . for an individual , it's no big deal to eat fewer hainan watermelons and bananas , but for producers and sellers of those products , the impact is way too much .
not long ago , shocking news concerning food safety exploded again in beijing : due to a rise in pork prices , people astonishingly used processed cardboard as filling for buns . this was known as cardboard-filled buns .
on hearing the news , i was shocked too . i felt these peddlers were too wily , going so far as to come up with a trick like this . furthermore , i spread this news far and wide , advising my family and friends never to buy buns on the street again .
but yesterday there was suddenly news that the report on cardboard-filled buns was a piece of fake news , that the whole story was fabricated by one person . while feeling relieved , i also wondered what has gone wrong in today 's news media .
the real truth is , as i learned from a reliable source , zi , a temporary member of the program transparency on beijing tv 's life channel , brought meat stuffing , flour , and cardboard bought from the market , and suggested that wei and others mix cardboard soaked in water into meat stuffing and make buns .
zi used a household dv camera he brought along to shoot the preparation process , followed by editing , then used deception to have the program broadcast .
currently the public security agency has lawfully taken the criminal suspect zi into criminal detention , and will deal with him sternly according to the law .
after the bun incident took place , the government quickly organized relevant departments to carry out investigations , and launched complete and thorough inspections of breakfast markets in beijing , to ensure the safety of common people 's meals .
after the incident was confirmed , beijing tv openly apologized to the public , that it had learned a profound lesson , that it seriously investigated and dealt with the relevant persons responsible , and that it will further strengthen management , shore up weaknesses , and resolutely put an end to false news reports .
it 's just that , although the cardboard-filled buns turned out to be imaginary , it is still uncertain when everyone will dare relax and buy buns from street stalls .
from one perspective , this incident also reflected the importance attached to food safety issues by the government , and its rapidity of action . and to a certain extent , it showed that common beijing people 's meals are relatively safe . though it turned out to be a false alarm , the bun incident served as a reminder to everyone !
toward whom should education be responsible ?
recently i listened to a friend back home talk about some news regarding a school , and couldn't refrain from expressing my personal feelings .
the incident happened at southwest weiyu middle school , a private secondary school in shanghai municipality .
the school decided to arrange its best teachers for three classes at the school which had directly entered high school from middle school through contract . meanwhile , several young teachers with no experience teaching third year high school students and with poor teaching records were assigned to teach classes admitted from outside schools through examination , or from the same school without signing the contract .
the reason was that the contract students agreed to give up applying to other high schools at that time , so according to the agreement , the school must ensure best teachers for them .
yet for students of other classes , the school 's position was : give young teachers a training opportunity .
i couldn't help but sigh with emotion . toward whom should education be responsible ?
i remember many years ago , when i was attending a key senior high school , with dissatisfaction about the teaching level of a math teacher , the whole class presumptuously signed their names requesting that the school replace the teacher .
later on , the school indeed replaced the teacher for us , since the school had promised us to treat all students equally , to be responsible toward all students .
ten years ago i came to america to pursue graduate studies .
one summer , when selecting courses for the coming semester , i found most of the elective courses offered in the department were strong in theory , while none of the few courses strong in functionality were offered .
i approached the dean to talk about it , telling him i thought there was a problem with the curriculum design .
the dean acknowledged that functional courses were not offered because there were not enough teachers . after one or two years , these courses would be offered when teachers were available .
i remember telling him then , " this is your problem , not mine .
i came thousands of miles away from shanghai to study in your school because i was attracted by the introduction of your courses .
if you aren't able to offer these courses , you shouldn't put them in the introduction . otherwise this is false advertising , irresponsible toward me and my family . "
after listening to what i said , the dean pondered for a moment and said : let me see what i can do .
maybe it was too late , since all the courses were already arranged for online registration .
three weeks later , the dean approached me to have a talk . he told me that his job was be responsible toward every student , including me , something to that effect .
he heard my suggestions and tried his best , adding two elective courses strong in functionality , hoping i would understand .
after this happened , i took several courses taught by the dean .
he never held anything against me for having expressed my opinions to him . for each of the courses , he justly gave me an a.
on the eve of graduation , i heard his secretary say that he had tried his best for each student , but not all students were appreciative toward him .
at the graduation ceremony , while giving a speech as an honors student representative , i told the dean : each of us feels heartfelt gratitude for all he did for us , because he tried his best to be responsible toward each of us .
i felt i had made a correct life choice to attend school here .
at this moment , i saw faint tears in the dean 's eyes .. i think that one day , if in china every educator and the entire educational system can take responsibility for each student , china will truly take off soon .
central ny men 's 4s volleyball tournament
last sunday we took part in the central ny men 's 4s volleyball tournament . the tournament lasted six and a half hours . in the end , our team won the championship .
this tournament was actually organized as a training tournament in preparation for the volleyball tournament of the empire state games summer athletic event in new york .
the coach divided up four participating men 's teams from central new york ( a high school team , a university team , a 35 and over team , and a 45 and over team ) , then regrouped them into teams of four players each , including a setter , to carry out the tournament .
the rules of the tournament were quite interesting . only back row players could attack , and dropping was not allowed within the three-meter line . only the setter could block , and there were no changes of position .
so it was basically testing the teams ' power attack strength , as well as defense , judgment , and positioning .
our team had a 2 meters tall offside hitter , who during attacks held the strong point and high point . he took care of more than 60 % of the attacks and points gained during the competition . a 1.85 meter tall setter had a number of one-man blocks .
a 1.9 meter tall middle hitter made a number of attack mistakes , since he was in a back row .
and me , a 1.75 meter tall left-side hitter , was mainly responsible for receiving opponents ' cross smashes , and occasionally launching surprise attacks at a decent success rate .
altogether , there were seven teams . first was a round robin competition . after our team won a match , the referee repeatedly called foot faults when our right-side hitter attacked , greatly demoralizing our players . utterly shattered , we lost three matches in succession .
but after losing the matches , everyone calmed down . during these three matches , our teamwork stabilized , then we began a winning streak .
after the round robin , our team had won three and lost three , good for 6th place in the group standings .
then came the additional matches . aside from the first place team , teams from 2nd to 7th place were randomly matched to play elimination games .
the mental state and strategy of our team was stable . our weapon was power , and we led all the way to reach the semifinals .
in the semifinal , our opponent was strong at attacking and weak at defending . though it made my arms black and blue , whenever i successfully took a powerful spike , i was twice as delighted as when i succeeded in a spike myself .
without even knowing what the final score was , we won .
during the final , our opponent was balanced at defending and attacking . we succeeded by destroying their attack with serves , and led all the way .
at the end , when the score was 21:24 , we had match point . two successive serves by the opposing team bounced off my arms as i was trying to dig . at 23:24 , our team 's offside hitter ran over and told me that it didn't matter , it was only two balls .
the next ball flew toward me again , and fortunately i took it well . the setter passed the ball back over his head to the offside hitter , and a powerful spike finished the battle .
talking about morals again
regarding free individuals , scattered about , a lot has been said about morals .
i have nothing to repeat in this respect .
what i'd like to say now is about collectivity .
every now and then , we encounter occasions where collectivity is needed .
on these occasions , for a collective , certain morals are needed .
we can often find certain positive morals in those once successful collectives .
this is by no means accidental .
because for these undertakings or activities , it's necessary to overcome certain immediate difficulties , to hold together as one , to put aside those faith-based factors . i believe that in addition , those good moral values are playing a role not to be ignored .
at the very least , a group of people all with very low moral values can hardly work together to achieve great things . that 's highly predictable .
to succeed , it might be an essential quality for a collective to have the wisdom of a rationally far-sighted view of long-term interests .
actually , collectives often use various methods to obtain an identity , such as logos , terminology , and beliefs , as well as moral values .
only when there is brandy in the morning and brandy in the evening can there be orchids everywhere on the road of life .
( an exploratory topic ) in life up to now , how many times have you truly felt happy ?
my close friend from high school finally received a visa . at the end of august , she can head off for graduate studies at a prestigious university on the west coast of america .
today , a few classmates got together . i was really happy for her , that her wish was fulfilled at long last .
seeing her so happy , i was really very envious .
recalling so long ago , i was only that happy during the time when i was admitted to high school . at that time it never occurred to me that i could be admitted to one of the top schools in the city . then as anticipated , i went to college , worked , during that time i never again experienced such happiness .
i was admitted to college , though it was not the one i had earlier desired , so i could not be greatly delighted .
during college , i pinned my hopes on going up north after graduation , to join my sweetheart with whom i had been in love for two years .
the gods did not give me good fortune , and one month before my graduation , he proposed breaking up . all my past dreams went up in smoke .
afterward , that is , i returned up north to work . to date , it has been almost two years since i started working . i have earned enough money for a decent car , but i have never again experienced such happiness .
today i chatted with my close friend . i have a great understanding of her happiness . having cautiously and diligently prepared for a year , now she is finally able to go abroad , to start a new life . that dream come true feeling is truly thrilling .
i have no plans to go on studying , and i dislike life in foreign countries , because i had worked abroad for half a year , and found life abroad unsuitable for me .
seeing my close friend happy , i couldn't help thinking : what about my dreams ?
what can make me feel that happy again ?
maybe finding someone who really likes me , is willing to be with me for the rest of my life .
i think at that time , i would cry with excitement , just as my close friend told me that when she passed the embassy interview and obtained the visa , she couldn't help crying . she was finally rewarded for a year 's diligence and concern .
but what about me ?
on the matter of feelings , time after time i've been cautious , working hard . when can i also have my wishes fulfilled and cry for joy ?
maybe i'm not worth anything . i have never had to worry about my personal career , yet how about my emotions ?
when will my emotions find a place to rest ?
on this issue , i've been constantly feeling very sad .
brothers and sisters , how do you feel ?
in life up to now , how many times have you truly felt happy ?
promoting southeast university school of architecture
hehe , also considered an introduction to the school of architecture for southeast university alumni .
the latest first-hand information plus my personal experiences . replacement guaranteed if it is fake .
dean wang , secretary an , teacher li of the personnel section , and several other teachers from the teaching and research office for architectural technology and science attended for the report . i talked for one hour , and then everyone talked for about one and a half hours .
after the formal report ended , teacher zhang ( assistant dean ) dragged me aside and told me that we were going to have a closed door talk in the office at the back .
he was extremely kind and affable . having closed the door , he told me that it was inappropriate to bring up certain subjects at a formal meeting . he said that he sensed i was unsure about my future income , and then informed me of some particular circumstances concerning teacher incomes at the school of architecture to reassure me .
prior to the report , dean wang gave a brief introduction of the school of architecture , saying that in the field of architecture , there are only six key courses throughout the country , namely two at southeast university , two at tsinghua , one at tongji , and one at tianjin university . there are no others besides these .
he said that in recent years , the state has attached special importance to energy conservation in architecture , eco-friendly architecture , and architectural technology and science . southeast university is interested in attracting a teacher for these areas ,
he said they received over 20 resumes applying for research work in this area , domestic , japanese , and american ( it seems the one was from me ) .
the school of architecture is very serious about this , and has carefully examined these applicants .
compared with architecture schools at some other universities that i know , that of southeast university is indeed in the lead . tongji should keep a step ahead of southeast university in urban planning , yet concerning the area of architectural design , it seems that southeast university could still be slightly ahead ( something i hadn't previously expected ) .
dean wang said the school of architecture has extremely sufficient scientific research funds in the past two years , with its status as an institution in the state 's 985 project for key engineering construction .
he told me that last year , southeast university 's school of architecture was given one-off financial support of 10 million from superior units as construction funds , of which 3.5 million was used directly in purchasing books for the architecture school 's specialized library . ( hehe , this is something even i would like to praise a bit . what a large move ! )
the rest of the funds were almost all used to purchase equipment for experiments in my research area .
rumor has it that several academicians have some complaints .
hehe .. by the way , i feel the college seemingly got ripped off on some imported equipment .
one experiment system for measuring indoor air-tightness , which is widely used in america and could have been obtained for an estimated 500 us dollars , cost southeast university 50 thousand rmb in the end ! ! !
there are other things as well . many colleges and departments of southeast university have now moved to the new campus at jiulong lake , but the school of architecture is determined to stay , saying it wants to provide students with a positive architectural atmosphere . on the old campus there are some classical buildings you can look at , which the new campus does not have .
hehe .. it seems that because other departments have moved out , the school of architecture was able to get another building .
so , dean wang told me straightforwardly that later i can be given my own single office .
i am very embarrassed that when dean wang was talking about this , i wasn't interested at all .
later , teacher zhang dragged me aside and told me that this is quite difficult and that even some old professors do not have single offices because office space is in extremely short supply .
this made me very uneasy . it seems that i still don't fully understate the state of the country .
in a word , i had a wonderful time at southeast university during this visit . leaders and relevant teachers at the school of architecture of southeast university left a positive impression on me with their extremely professional dedication and enthusiasm .
may southeast university develop smoothly , and the school of architecture keep its lead !
the qinhuai river amid the splashing oar sounds and lantern shades
there is no banquet in this world that will not come to an end
i had lunch with my colleagues two weeks ago , bidding farewell to the previous boss .
this boss is recognized as a gallant character among women , and treated us subordinates very well . so we also willingly worked for her , even to the extent of working overtime at night and during weekends , which is rarely seen among americans . she is also considered to be the best boss i've worked for .
because of the need to care for her family and to have more time to educate the children , she left the company and opened a math tutoring center focusing on elementary and middle school students .
i believe that she will succeed in whatever she does !
sun yanzi sends loving care to africa , encounters sandstorm , sustains stone throwing and cuts ( photo compilation )
taking care of sick children .
displaying " arm muscle . "
after the congo visit , sun yanzi has followed world vision to africa 's niger on a second occasion .
at the press conference yesterday , she frankly admitted that this was by far the most grueling journey ever .
the local weather was hot , drinking water was murky , and while visiting the market , she ran into the locals angrily throwing stones in protest , even riding on the camel resulted in cuts sustained from the camel seat .
an eventful journey along the way made her shouted aloud in her heart on several occasions : " i really want to go home ! "
startled to see malnourished young children
with three consecutive years of joining world vision activities to care for poor children , sun yanzi professes to be an experienced spokesperson .
she brought along 30 bottles of vitamins , 40 sets of flashlights and 500 candies to be shared with the local children .
she said that based on much cumulative experiences , the small gifts are always never enough for use no matter how many were brought along .
in nigeria the most serious issue is that mothers have no idea at all in upbringing and young children have serious malnutrition problems .
during her eight-hour car ride from the capital of niger to tawa , a small town 500km away , sun yanzi experienced a sandstorm which was rarely seen locally .
winds blowing the sand , accompanied with rainwater , the colors changed throughout the whole sky .
the jeep she rode in was swaying even more with the wind .
thinking back of that time , sun yanzi disclosed with a lingering fear that although inside the vehicle , she was still very much afraid .
only when she later heard the local people explaining that sandstorm is a symbol of good luck , bringing rainwater to moisturize the earth did she feel slightly relieved .
together with the local residents .
saddened by mothers with upbringing problems
upon arriving at tawa , the local officials held a welcoming ceremony on a dromedary and invited sun yanzi to sit on the camel to receive the acclamation of the locals ,
but the camel , frightened by the camera flash , went completely beyond control and almost threw sun yanzi off onto the ground ,
in the end sun yanzi leapt down on her own , however her carelessness caused her clothing to be ripped by the seat mat which scratched her back and left behind a small bloody mark about 8cm long .
on this trip , sun yanzi visited four local children who were seriously undernourished and ill . among them was a four-month-old baby , weighing only 2.1kg , who didn't look like a human being at all .
she said : " the sight of him saddened me . his condition is really too extreme , but it should also be a problem of the mother , who should be taught about the right nutrition concept . "

survival -- includes physical strengthening and mental strengthening
1 . physical strengthening -- increases physical strength through various physical +activities , strengthens coordination , enabling the exercising ability to be continuously increased , thus sufficiently satisfying the needs of physical activities , as well as the needs in dealings with society .
2 . mental strengthening -- able to understand more clearly the society one is in , know oneself , learn to deal with others , learn the skill to adapt to survive and experience enjoyment .
the above discusses the purpose of education , with not much of a relation to this article . now let 's discuss the key point : key to china 's education -- humanistic .
the essential nature of being humanistic is : fully understand the differences of individuals and that they can not be perceived as the same .
club original : several frequently seen stages of learning from buffett
club original : several frequently seen stages of learning from buffett : i am taking a stroll
1) stage 1 : initial acquaintance with buffett gave you the feeling as though you had gotten an invaluable treasure , and you immediately put it into practice . but at this time , your learning of buffett 's concept is still not deep , not penetrative . more often than not , much will be used wrongly , used haphazardly , and used blindly , so it's effective sometimes and ineffective some other times .
2) stage 2 : " outsmart " buffett . after going through a period of learning and practice , almost every " intelligent person " will be pondering over a few questions : for example , what would a buffett with chinese characteristics be like ?
should the theories of buffett be flexibly applied in china ?
can we do better than buffett ?
therefore this stage is mainly characterized by your presumption and blind arrogance in your search for a buffett theory with chinese characteristics .
after going through a period of practice , more often than not , it's still effective sometimes and ineffective some other times , with no continuity . if you're lucky , it is best to take a little loss , and turn back early .
3) stage 3 : back to buffett . after having gone through a few setbacks , you've finally come to realize that you're just a normal human being , not a genius .
the expectations set to yourself should be a little lower , just earnestly learning from buffett would fully suffice .
the simplest , on the contrary , is the most effective , but simple methods often encompass profound theories , and these theories must be understood before simplicity can be carried out right to the end .
the performance of this stage is not great for short term results , not too little for long term results , and has continuity .
4) stage 4 : " stubborn " buffett . after tasting consistent results , the theories of buffett are basically entrenched in this stage , and your attitude toward non-buffett companies is complete indifference .
you continuously learn and deepen the understanding of buffett and put it into practice . the performance at this stage is getting better and better results , with continuity , and entering a virtuous cycle .
for every stage the time needed by each individual varies and is related both to individual situations and luck .

he is one of my old internet pals , who circulated such a story in the group .
i would rather write this story in this column .
i hope that everyone will read this article . it is not expected to become the so-called finest , but some things and some truth can often be appreciated and obtained from a short and pithy story .
this is a story that will make people feel coldness in the heart after they have finished reading it .
i really wish that this is really just a fiction .. because my heart feels really sad ..
three gunmen on a mountainous road apparently set their sights on this beautiful female driver , forcing the mid-size bus to stop and wanting to bring the female driver off the vehicle for some fun . the female driver frantically shouted for help , yet all the bus passengers went absolutely silent .
only a middle-aged thin , feeble man stepped forward bravely in response , but was beaten up and lay wounded on the ground .
the man was furious , shouting and clamoring for all the bus passengers to stop this barbaric behavior , but no one answered . the female driver was dragged without restraint to the thick bushes in the forestry .
half an hour later , the three villains returned with the female driver whose clothing was disheveled .
the bus was about to continue on its journey . the female driver wanted the wounded and bleeding thinly weak man to get off the bus .
the man refused , and firmly stood up .
hey , you get off the bus . my bus is not taking you !
the middle-aged man was vexed , and said : you are such an unreasonable person , was i wrong to try save you ?
you save me ?
what did you save me from ?
the female driver denied vehemently , drawing secret laughter from a few passengers .
the middle-aged man was enraged , hating himself for not having the might of a chivalrous valiant !
even though the rescue was not successful , but still it should not have to result in him being driven off the bus . he was adamant on not getting off .
by the way , i have bought the ticket , and i have the right to sit on the bus !
the driver lifted her face coldly and said : if you don't get off , then i will not drive .
unexpectedly , the busload of passengers who turned a blind eye to the brutal act earlier , as though just awoken from sleep , banded together to persuade the man to alight the bus : get off quickly , we still have other matters , and can't afford any delay !
a few strong and burly passengers even thought of going forward to drag the middle-aged man off the bus , causing one to think of the plot in the story " boule de suif " written by maupassant .
the three villains gloated , grinning gleefully .
among them was a black skinned scoundrel who unabashedly said : we brothers have played her well !
the other two villains also blabbered nonsense : she is my partner , it is none of your business !
a quarrel ensued , until that man 's luggage was thrown out the bus window , and he was pushed violently down subsequently .
the bus was once again smoothly traveling on the mountainous road . the female driver stroked her hair once , and pressed on the tape recorder .
the bus was reaching the hill-top , and would go downhill round the bend . on the left side of the bus was a road carved into the mountain , on the right was an overhanging steep cliff .
the bus quietly increased speed , and the female driver 's face was extremely calm , both hands tightly gripping on the steering wheel , as tears glistened in the eyes .
one of the villains sort of detected something , and said : drive slowly , drive slowly , what the hell are you trying to do ?
the female driver did not speak up . the speed of the bus became faster and faster .
the villains attempted to grab the steering wheel , but instead the bus was like an arrow that had left its bowstring shooting towards the cliff ..
on the next day , the local newspapers reported : fatal accident occurred at fuhu mountain range yesterday , a mid-size bus tumbled down the cliff .
the bus driver and thirteen passengers were all killed .
the middle-aged man who was chased off the bus halfway on the road cried upon reading the newspaper .
no one knows what he was crying for , or why he was crying .
the dark side of train stations
recently i've been out for a few days . traveling by train , i discovered the dark side of various train stations during the summer transportation season !
i wish to understand what is there to pay attention to at the various train stations .
i am from changsha , let 's talk about the condition in changsha first , everyone going to changsha train station must take note of it !
1 . train tickets that take forever to buy : at changsha train station , during every major holiday or the beginning and the end of school winter and summer recesses , it is absolutely impossible to buy tickets , even going early to queue would be futile .
the most flawless reply i've gotten from my query was that the travel agency has booked all the tickets !
but from ticket scalpers , just pay more money , you can get as many as can be .
2 . beware of fake tickets : the tickets from ticket scalpers might not be genuine . shuangfen and xinhua in hunan got rich , one by relying on fake certificates and licenses , and the other by depending on fake silver coins and fake coins , so fake ticket is really no big deal !
to patch up is of the lowest class . some fake tickets masquerade as real ones so well that even train staff can't tell apart !
3 . who has touched my bill : when buying things in stores at the train station , one has to be extra careful !
if you wish to pay in small change , ha-ha , your bill will always be missing a corner , so you have to change to large denomination bills .
but after you have replaced them with large denomination bills , the shop owner would definitely say it can't be broken up after he has got it in his hand , and still want to accept your small bills missing a corner after returning your big bill , by this time you just have to take back a piece of fake big bill !
4 . magician gives changes : not all shop owners will swap your big bill , as that is against the law , and the risk is higher !
therefore a few " timid " shop owners have to resort to being magicians . you clearly see him calculating the change to be correct , but wait till you have the chance to calculate on your own . ha-ha , it's short of a few bills .
5 . foreign liquors everywhere : there are not too many teahouses at the train station , but after entering you will understand .
few glasses of inferior quality red wine can be sold at martell 's price . if you do not pay for it , probably even your mother will not recognize you afterwards .
6 . rose and firearms : around the train station are numerous video halls . the titles of the shows played may still seem very attractive to us common men . so if you enter to take a look , you will surely be deemed as a distinguished guest with thoughts to relax . then immediately a rose girl will come over to keep you company . of course you have to be able to afford the expenses of a five-star hotel ; otherwise the machete will not always be chopping in the direction of foreigners !
7 . ice and fire : if you have a changsha 's accent or are very familiar with changsha , then you can forever give up the thought of getting a cab at the front of the station . the face of the cab driver can let you know what is called a frosty june !
but if it is your first time coming to changsha , congratulations to you . even if you are going to a place within five minutes ' walking distance , the driver will warmly bring you to admire for a while some of the finesse in a state-level major tourist city , and will even let you have a gulp of the famous baisha brand secondhand smoke , and a sniff of the distinctly local taste of the betel nut .
of course , you have to fork out the transport fare on your own , don't you ?
nanjing subway driver should undergo psychological counseling as soon as possible
keywords : psychological counseling
according to the report by xinhua news agency , on the evening of july 3 , a suicide was committed on the railway track of nanjing subway .
according to the description of the reporter , " zhu zhengting , age 22 , a young subway driver , met with a nightmarish scene . yesterday when the reporter met him , he seemed to have not yet recovered from the horror , sitting upright on the chair , and his eyes looked a little entranced . "
obviously , the psychology of this young driver has been dealt with a huge blow and urgently requires psychological counseling , or would otherwise impair him for life .
not sure if everyone still remembers an incident that took place more than a decade ago . the rescuer who saved a little girl from an abandoned oil well in the us state of texas finally chose to commit suicide and ended a painful life after having gone through long periods of psychological torture .
at that time , though he was put through simple psychological counseling , but , as people placed greater attention on the little girl who was rescued , yet neglecting the person who needed psychological counseling even more , they finally failed to prevent the tragedy from happening .
similarly , in the dover straits smuggling incident a few years back , the first british police officer that opened up the container was said to have fainted in fright on the spot .
subsequently , the british side carried out more than two months of psychological counseling on him before he had recovered and returned to normal .
the psychology of humans will sustain huge damages after suffering catastrophic shocks . at this moment , it is very difficult to thoroughly recover depending solely on one 's individual efforts . an emotional scar will often be left behind .
as such emotional scar is very difficult to be discovered by outsiders , and even if it is discovered , there is nothing that can be done , most parties concerned will suffer for life .
however , people in our country do not pay enough attention to caring about psychological trauma . especially it is often after the optimum recovery period has lapsed that the family members or governing authorities of the parties concerned suddenly recall ; it is all too late then .
nowadays , with the diversification of the media , we often hear of some heart-wrenching incidents , where many young teenage girls were hurt , and many young children saw with their own eyes the cruel sufferings inflicted on their own parents .
after these teenagers have been rescued , they are not often heard to have received psychological therapy ; more often relatives are engaged in kinship solace .
even though victims may feel that they are already safe , the previous hurt has become a permanently incurable scar , always to be awoken , affecting the lives of the parties concerned .
it is gratifying to know that the superior of this driver has given him timely consolation which could also release some of his psychological pressure .
after all the responsibility of the incident does not lie with the driver and the driver has also taken all measures when he discovered the situation . he has done all he could except for stopping the tragedy from happening .
i believe that even if it is not the driver concerned , anyone present at the scene would have been given a fright with the happening of the incident .
however , despite being given a fright , the others have no connection of responsibility to the suicide victim and can gradually forget over time .
the driver concerned is not so lucky ; he has to remember , and probably for life .
if he can free himself from it , he can count his blessings ; but if he cannot free himself from it , he will often be tortured by such a fright .
the modern concept of health is more comprehensive than in the past , and mental health has started to be watched closely by people .
it is regrettable that the mental state of mankind is depressing , especially in cities , where the mental state of people is not ideal , and most people more or less have hidden depression , while some people have not been able to arouse adequate attention when they are faced with problems .
thinking about the earlier lesson with the " yang lijuan incident , " some irresponsible media have made the torturous mental issue of a patient as a tabloid subject , causing bad influence to society ,
such incidents should be prevented in the future , otherwise our society will really become a morbid society .
the five teachers of dongkou no.5 middle school have much sentiments after the 1st phase of new curriculum training
keywords : dongkou no.5 middle school , teacher 's 1st phase , new curriculum training the five teachers of dongkou no.5 middle school have much sentiments after the 1st phase of new curriculum training from the morning of july 13 till the 15th , the first batch of dongkou no.5 middle school teachers who participated in the new curriculum training began to truly feel the pressure and motivation of the new curriculum .
at the same time they also feel that the new curriculum reform is a rare opportunity and challenge to the school education advancement .
on the morning of the 13th , due to the road repair on sections of dongkou 's shijiang and longhui road causing vehicles to be blocked , by the time the few teachers of dongkou no.5 middle school and the teachers from suining and other locations rushed to the city department of education , it was already past 1pm , and already long past office hours , yet the education department staff unloaded the training materials that were already loaded onto the vehicle , just to process relevant procedures for us . we collected the training materials .
at 2:30 in the afternoon , the teachers who were dust covered and tired from traveling braved the summer heat and separately entered city no.1 middle school , city no.2 middle school , and city no.6 middle school multimedia classrooms to listen to the lectures by relevant experts .
in the subsequent two days , the teachers either listened to the lectures given by authors of the teaching materials or listened to the teaching experiences of the teachers from the provinces that have already entered the new curriculum reform . some of teaching researchers or teachers who had participated in the new provincial curriculum training also presented their learning experiences and gains .
on the morning of the 15th , after listening to all the training courses , there was also an exam . the five teachers from dongkou no.5 middle school , due to their conscientious learning , with no tardiness nor leaving early , had smoothly passed the examination and received their completion certificates .
during training periods , teachers of dongkou no.5 middle school had mutual exchanges amongst themselves . initially they all felt that the new curriculum tends to be rather unfamiliar , heavier in assignments , have greater pressure , and not easy to grasp .
however , after the training , everyone felt that this is also an opportunity and a challenge .
all were determined to strive to adjust their knowledge structure , and satisfactorily complete the task of curriculum reform as much as possible .
the second batch of teachers participating in the new curriculum training has already arrived on the 16th at relevant locations to undergo training .

happy to make friends with fans of superstars
keywords : fans of superstars
i have a female friend whom i have never seen before .
i told her directly , i truly admire you !
because you have directly expressed your love .
she likes this male host of a popular taiwan variety program and never conceals such feelings .
when this male host was presenting a program in jinan , she flew to jinan ; when this male host went to changsha as a guest performer , she flew to changsha .
the male host said in a book that a friend gave him a catapult with no pellets , and she told me in pleasant surprise that " the catapult was given by me . "
she also participated in doing up an e-magazine on this superstar , and she'd show me every edition very happily .
all along i pretty much like to associate with some of those people who honestly identify themselves as fans of certain superstars .
these superstars can be movie or tv stars , sports stars , or can also be a great man .
i've never felt these friends to be superficial , and i feel that they are so adorable .
these people are usually genuine in nature , like means like , dislike means dislike .
to be in contact with this type of people , it will be very relaxing .
even though they will not take into consideration 100 % of your feelings , at least you do know what they are happy and sad about ; and know that there will be a greater sense of security associating with them .
these people are also very honest .
do you know that with regard to expressing one 's likes , some bravery is also needed ?
because of this , many people just silently like one person in a lifetime , or perhaps he might also look down on those who brazenly claim to be a fan of so-and-so .
honesty is to me the biggest virtue in a person , be honest to friends , and be honest to yourself .
but to achieve this point is actually very difficult .
to be able to like a celebrity also proves that deep in his heart there are selfless elements .
some of my friends are fans of some superstars .
sometimes in order to take a glance at the superstar , they can endure hardship and can make many sacrifices , scrimping to eat less , with the left hand raising a banner , and the right hand clicking the camera , while the mouth is screaming away .
it can be said that they are foolish , immature , but to be able to love someone without asking for any returns , this requires much selflessness .
because in reality there are so much narcissism , self-conceitedness , and nonchalance toward others that this selflessness appears to be valuable .
thus , when everyone starts to chat and talk about one 's likes for so-and-so superstar , if someone should say that i have never idolized anyone ,
ha-ha , you must be careful then .
teresa cheung , the person
keywords : teresa cheung
by chance i watched an edition of the kangxi come , starring teresa cheung , that i haven't seen for ages .
i think that was when color blossoms was being promoted .
at the time i watched color blossoms , i was obsessed with erotic movies .
at that time i was surprised that pornographic movies could be made with such aesthetic appeal , and are also sometimes very interesting . they are called erotic movies .
actually i have not seen many erotic movies , but they have been from quite a few countries .
the very first ones i saw were south korean and japanese .
later i also saw several movies from countries of the third world , latin america , and europe , but i seldom saw hollywood or french movies .
of these , there are two movies which i can't bear to delete from my computer . one is youth , the other is color blossoms .
the first half of color blossoms is pretty good . everyone is a newcomer , putting forth a lot of effort in acting . the director is also disciplined .
the latter half is somewhat abnormal . i could not take it at all .
in fact what i want to say is that teresa cheung says on the program that she has had boyfriends in almost every country in the world , except in africa .
at present , she has four boyfriends .
regarding this , i am afraid average people cannot take this . they would say this person is loose .
but the key issue is she was very candid when talking about these issues , did not carry herself in any way that would make people uncomfortable .
she also talked about her own thoughts about love .
for instance , both people should be financially independent .
i assume that personalities should also be independent ; so each controls their own destiny .
for i know that when people are in love , love is living , is selfish . how can you allow the person you love to accept someone else 's love at the same time ?
based on my experience and assumptions , i think teresa cheung 's love must not have been simple sentimentality . it must have been typical elder-sister-younger-brother love .
in elder-sister-younger-brother love , the elder sister can accommodate anything , including possessing several younger brothers at the same time . meanwhile , the younger brother can emotionally become attached to the elder sister without reservation , because of her attractiveness and motherliness . however , he perhaps does not mind whether he is the only one , and so on .
but from teresa cheung 's words , i also noticed that she is actually a person who really knows how to enjoy life .
for instance , she loves to travel to the point of being +crazy .
so i have reason to believe that she also has a very splendid life .
if this was before , i'm afraid that i would not have accepted these phenomena .
similarly , i have now accepted many people . in fact this has little to do with tolerance . rather , as long as one straightens his thoughts , there won't be any absolute love or non-love .
these people are , for instance , passerby a , friend b , zhang ziyi , buddy c , and sister lotus .
when looking at other people 's lives , you yourself are an observer . to other people , how can you not be the owner of your own life ?
this is just like : although i am no longer in jianghu , my legend will always be in jianghu .
people should always have some entertaining spirit
keywords : entertaining spirit
a person 's life is a very tiring thing , so we should have some entertaining spirit .
either satirize ourselves , or see others making fools of themselves , gossip about others .
for instance , go to tian ya 's " entertaining gossip " board and relax .
inside , everybody speaks freely . but of course , you should have some ability to tell right from wrong , because various " wrongs " occur all the time .
the consequence of " say whatever you want " is that you end up not knowing what you are talking about . yet you should be clear about what you are looking at .
little s called kevin tsai a " scholar . "
if i am considered one , then i'd be the type who has read a little bit , but has not yet fully grasped the meaning .
fortunately , i would always know my own limitations .
but simply put , in doing a little bit of reading , i have gotten some things that i wanted to get .
and it so happens that i like to think aimlessly , so i think while reading , and that way get to understand many truths , many things become suddenly clear .
therefore , i have slowly cultivated some habits . for example , i tell myself to be a bit harder on myself , and a bit nicer to others .
whenever encountering a problem , first search for an explanation within myself .
handle things with a little bit of reason , handle friendship with a little bit of emotion .
be a reserved person , do things with a low profile .
but you know , people are not that good . they will always be selfish , will always consider their own gains and losses , will always be extremely emotional when reason is called for , and damned rational when it is time for passion .
the good thing is , i won't regret the choices i make .
what 's done is done , i accept the consequences of failure .
why think about so many useless things .
it 's good that i am not that kind of uptight person , acting in ways to enhance my scholarly status . i am just an ordinary person .
only i'm different from some people in that i don't have to be cynical , i'm a little bit rational with everything .
or for instance , my faith is particularly strong .
once i come to trust someone , then i believe everything about him is good .
if there are deficiencies , i am more than willing to accommodate them .
even though i'm not the kind of person who is surrounded by friends , i'm the type who puts oneself in friends ' shoes .
but because of this , i'm quite serious in choosing friends .
i also really can't understand why currently there are so many people who believe so much of what 's in the newspaper .
or else in their minds , reports nowadays are just as sacred as in the past .
but in this world , there are still a lot of things i don't understand .
joking .
i slap myself on the face .
song dandan 's " the secrets of happiness " is warm and touching .
keywords : song dandan , the secrets of happiness
i recently read in the newspaper that song dandan has newly published a book called the secrets of happiness .
i really wanted to read it ,
because i wondered how a woman who has reached this age , having this kind of profession , having experienced changes in family and career , after these , would perceive herself and life .
as expected , i was not disappointed . after reading it , there were two things that touched me : first , it was like i got an electric shock , for looking at other people 's lives can be the same as seeing one 's own shadow ; second , i was very moved by the detailed aspects of some close family relationships .
why did i get an electric shock ?
song dandan wrote in the book : " i overlooked an important principle in life : giving is more rewarding than receiving . "
" i am always busy with giving , busy making myself happy . "
i cannot , nor do i really know how to receive . i overlooked allowing others to give , that is , overlooked other people 's right to achieve happiness . "
i realized that i myself have been enjoying such happiness . i probably should pay some attention to this matter in the future .
if one can honestly face one 's past , present it all to the public , this takes substantial courage .
this book covers her first love , her unsuccessful marriage with ying da , as well as in-depth self analysis , and the close relationship with her son .
this book is also worth praising for another point , because the publisher originally must have pushed her very hard to focus on i love my family , ambush from all sides , and the series of shows partnered with zhao benshan .
yet she must have persevered , with zhao benshan only mentioned at the very end . as for ambush from all sides and i love my family , they are hardly mentioned .
this book is suffused with a 40-year-old woman 's insights about life , love , family , and relationships . it is warm and touching .
a busy vacation
keywords : vacation , busy
i have been on vacation for nearly a week , but still haven't had any free time .
i went to the university for a meeting , and have to prepare documents and a draft speech for a meeting i will attend next week .
this vacation is going to be very busy .
if nothing unexpected happens , according to my plan , there are three meetings to attend , four or five cities to go to .
life is suddenly filled with many contents , of the same and different categories . i have almost forgotten how vacations were spent in the past .
it seems from my memories that there wasn't much free time , either .
it 's only that in the past , i used to have long periods of time that i could arrange myself , while this year there seems to be less time .
good thing ? or bad thing ?
being busy can be more gratifying , but if it yields no effects or accomplishments , the importance of being busy has to be discounted .
but sometimes it seems that life cannot be entirely measured by effects . life is to be enjoyed leisurely . being relaxed , peaceful , fulfilled , and happy is also a kind of achievement , even though sometimes such achievement can't be measured by the standard of social evaluation .
everyone needs to be recognized according to social values and self values . if the two can't be obtained together , what can we do ?
marxism teaches us to first respect social values , asking individuals to make contributions to society . but in fact , a healthy and sound society should also fully respect individuals ' wishes and value choices , and create conditions for realizing individual values .
i suddenly thought about these , and increasingly discovered that the marxist theory is really very effective .
surely , it's true in theory , but sometimes people in real life will inevitably get confused .
even if realizing self values would not jeopardize social values , would each of us actual individuals content ourselves with truthful self realization without worrying about social evaluation ?
or can our satisfaction with self values depart from social evaluation ?
it seems very difficult .
therefore each of us , while trying our best to be good ordinary and common individuals , will inevitably seek the uncommon and extraordinary ; but if life is wasted , we will always blame ourselves .
this is probably one social characteristic of people .
going on vacation , it has been somewhat relaxing .
at a minimum , i can have time to watch dvds , can relax and play for awhile .
just a couple of thoughts , work has to be done , the days go on as usual .
next week again , i have to go to xi'an for a meeting .
although i haven't been to , i don't seem to like the city very much , due to some " biases . "
i hope this trip can change my perception of the city , haha .
" living very much as a feminist "
keywords : male , feminist , era
in the afternoon , ying called me , and we chatted for a while , then i mentioned i watched happy boys .
ying said : " how can this be ? you are so adorable . after watching super girls you are watching happy boys . you must be a hunan satellite tv 's faithful viewer . "
i said that 's right .
ying said she had seen a few male talent search programs and felt that they are just sissies , my sentiments exactly , but i told her that happy boys has reached top 4 out of 5 , next week will be top 3 out of 4 , with all singing exceptionally well , and each being excellent .
ying , who studies mass culture and consumer culture , said excitedly that she wanted to watch it in the coming week , after all it has reached the most crucial stage of the competition and is surely worth watching . paying close attention to these may just as well accumulate a few case study resources for future studies .
next we chatted about this being a pretty boy 's era .
men finally become the " subject " from being the " spectator , " while women , who were previously " objects , " become " principal parties " and can , from an observer 's point of view , appreciate and face a variety of male talent shows in this pretty boy 's era .
ying said this is a woman 's liberation and is kind of a feminism hallmark .
then she went on to say : " don't you feel that you are living very much like a feminist ? "
hearing ying 's remark , i laughed aloud happily .
this remark itself is significantly filled with feminism , only that i do not have as good a discerning ability as ying 's to be able to elaborate on these things more profoundly and clearly .
i like the song by chen chusheng on happy boys very much . there is a kind of special touch , the kind of strength that pin-points to a person 's heart and penetrates through space and time , extremely crystal-clear and very soothing .
su xing 's songs have got many styles , with plentiful feelings . his features are elegant and gentle , yet giving people a feel of relaxation and cheeriness .
zhang jie 's songs are full of resonance and energy , especially the two songs he presented challengingly today , the way you are and past gone with the wind , both of which are oldies that i like very much , with a deep impression .
wei chen bears a resemblance to lu yi 's cute and fresh face . he was said to be well liked by girls , and of course the voice is not bad too .
with these top four contesting at the next stage , this should be good to watch .
i'm looking forward to watching their exciting performance next week !
jun. 29 , a day of confused and mixed " kimchi " feeling
keywords : kimchi , seoul
jun. 29 , a day of confused and mixed " kimchi " feeling international roaming has been activated , but after disembarking from the plane , the cellular phone seems as though to have a flat battery , still not displaying even one bar of reception , perhaps the extent of global roaming refers to the reach of the heart , and takes effect only upon the next payment due date .
for the next few days , i will be out of touch with everyone for a brief period . ha-ha , will anyone worry for me as a result ?
switching on the voicemail service is only a wish to prove who are the ones missing me .
whether it is for business or personal .
but the issue is , who do i wish to be missed by ?
my heart , i wonder when it has started , is becoming blank again .
i don't understand why there will always be some people whom you wish for them to stay but just can't hold them back , while there will be those whom you don't wish for them to stay but they always think that they can squeeze themselves in . is this like discussing the business world ?
but can the heart , regardless whether there is a place for you or not , always allow itself to be stuffed with these " white gloves ? "
after all , materialism and the heart just cannot be equally compared !
our vehicle is driving along the highway to busan .
the department chief is driving without uttering a word , and there 's nothing for me to speak up either ,
after all he does not understand chinese nor comprehend english , while i merely speak a few expressions in broken english .
i'm looking at the computer and striking on the keyboard in considerable boredom , besides the noise of the keyboard in the vehicle , there 's the cheerful voice of the korean girl from the gprs navigation device , and everything seems to be exceptionally calm .
out of the window , all that could be seen is merely the uninterrupted greenery and grayish blue sky .
keeping silent doesn't seem much to be my character .
unexpectedly , english is the only thing that induced a sense of endearment to me in this country ,
to me , the scene of circles appearing before my eyes no longer has any other function except for inducing the effect of dizziness caused by radiation .
i think , korea will definitely not be producing compasses .
because , there is no demand in the market .
seoul is very clean , thoroughly clean , meticulously clean .
unfortunately , during my few days of stay in seoul , i didn't have the time to visit other places besides the work place and the department store ; all impression was limited purely to the views along the road .
fortunately , everything still remains lovely !
koreans are traditionally courteous , a methodical smile , intent listening , refined and sedate ,
all that can be observed is the beautiful appearance , traditional customs , ancient architectures , and the scrupulous civilization .
is this hypocritical ?
it is still better to be hypocritical , at least everyone is polite !
the ugly side of things that is not seen may be perceived as non-existent .
korea cuisine is excellent !
just that i don't like and don't understand why is it that all the choices here and there are just kimchi presented in different forms and assortment , and of course , seaweed is indispensable too .
in retrospect , koreans are very adept in their gastronomical knowledge . they can differentiate the difference between kimchi preserved above ground or underground , as well as the length of time , where the precision can be down to the minute .
this indirectly shows that the conscientiousness of koreans may be related to their consumption of kimchi from morning till night .
the only headache is that i don't know what kind of recipe combining kimchi will be used at that japanese tofu restaurant the department chief is bringing us to .
recalling the chinese cuisine last night , i sort of felt like crying . the dishes were all localized to suit the korean taste , and the only thing edible ended up to be kimchi .
ah , thanks to china southern airlines that provides kimchi along with its in-flight meal .
the airline must think that i should start adapting right from the moment i board the plane .
two more days to go before i return to my country . if there is still no one i might miss , then it is better off to reminisce the braised meat prepared by auntie .
after all , contentment of the stomach is relatively more direct than the heart .
naturally , this has nothing to do with kimchi .
two trees
two trees , one is me , the other was my brother-in-law .
we mutually provided shade and took care of each other .
people of my generation typically have many children , but i only have elder and younger sisters , no brothers at all , hence the appearance of my brother-in-law was extremely important .
we are all kids from poor background , joining in the numerous family chores since young . although i had been striving to put on a manly front all along and wishing to complete the tasks like an expert , recognition from my father was never received .
i had the disorder of sleep walking since young . though not too serious , it was inevitable that i was absent-minded when doing the house chores .
for example , my dad wanted me to patch up some cement to the chimney of our old house , and i deftly climbed up the roof to do it .
the chimney was patched up fine , but when rain came , the house leaked with water , the reason being that i had trampled on the roof tiles and broke them .
take for another example , my dad asked me to change the light bulb , the kind with old fashioned incandescent bulbs .
by the time i stepped onto the stool , the bulb had instead dropped from the grip of my hands onto the concrete floor and shattered .
examples like these are too numerous to give ; therefore when my brother-in-law entered my family , these nitty-gritty tasks were naturally undertaken by him , and they were beautifully done , not requiring any outlay of labor cost .
meanwhile , i was happily stashed away in a corner reading those brick-like books leisurely .
after that we grew into two trees , two large trees that could sufficiently support the pillar of a family .
and my dad was inevitably diminished , and sitting in his wheelchair , he has become an anonymous shrub under the dense shade .
who would have expected the sudden change in situation when my 50-year old brother-in-law suddenly came down with a serious illness . it was hard to believe that this green and luxuriant big tree on the surface was approaching that fearful death .
on that dazzlingly sunny summer day , just outside of the operation room in peking union medical college hospital , the doctor delicately said : there is no value in surgery anymore .
at most he can live for another two months .
at that moment i felt like i was suddenly being shot by a stray bullet ; my soul had instantly left my body , and i stood there rigidly like an idiot .
i started to sleep walk again , seeing the old courtyard of our house , and the busy figure of my young brother-in-law in the courtyard .
it was the screech of my elder sister that awoke me . i hurriedly ran to hug my sister who had collapsed on the corridor of the hospital ; our tears flowed all over our faces as we hugged together .
the bright sun had suddenly disappeared , and darkness formed before my eyes .
after returning to our city from beijing , my brother-in-law knew of his own condition very quickly , and after a session of bitter crying with my elder sister , his mood returned back to normal instead .
my brother-in-law started to methodically go about his after death arrangements , for example , telling his own son : take care of your granny for me ; her remains are to be placed together with your granddad 's after her death , and this is how the tomb should be opened up to put the bones together .
go and visit your maternal grandfather often , and buy some practical stuff for him to use on holidays and new year .
for example , he said to my younger sister : after i leave , you must come often to see your elder sister , for she will definitely feel very lonely being all alone .
i did my best to find time to visit him . when facing me , he looked regretful instead .
we often had nothing to say facing each other , just like two trees unable to speak to each other though they are alive .
these are two grown trees , the training and experience from the elements have made us able to face difficulties calmly , what is there to relay to me ?
it seemed that there was no need to do so .
because you know in your heart : after you leave , my elder sister , and your children with my elder sister , and this big family , can only depend on this tree which is me for sole support .
why am i born a man ?
as a man , regardless whether you are willing or not , you have to lift up your shoulders without hesitation and undertake the duty .
the only regretful thing is : why would your tree wither so early , shouldn't you have a rich and splendid old age ?
the day you left was the first day of the chinese new year .
it was a time when chinese all over the world happily ushered in the new spring , yet you left on your own .
perhaps in another dimension , there is the birth of yet another new young life ?
the n-minutes of life
the reason to have such a fashionable looking topic is because in that moment of extreme despair , the hazy mind is absolutely too occupied to care about time .
like an innocent one , receiving a death sentence ruling out of thin air , can he still calmly challenge the grammar errors in the " verdict ? "
that was a winter 's day , and it was cold in the youth section .
i don't know who was on duty for the day , and there was no fire set up in the fireplace for the whole day .
because there were rumors of strong earthquake , upon returning back indoors in the evening , we were just too lazy to start the fire again .
on the long wide bed which could sleep 12 people , the four of us wrapped ourselves in cotton quilts , and were playing the poker game of " 3-beat-1 " while trembling under the dim lights , to win our meal tickets .
suddenly , a surging noise from afar was approaching . the few of us looked at one another just for a brief moment and immediately became aware of the impending catastrophe .
so we threw aside the cards in our hands , threw ourselves to the ground , squeezed through two narrow room doors , and swarmed out .
just at that moment when we ran out from our dormitory , that poor thatched cottage laid from stones was reduced to rubbles in a flash .
those of us who rushed to the courtyard felt as if we were standing on a staggering boat , like a tumbler rocking front and back , unable to stand steady .
in those few seconds , all the buildings around us , +contrary to the past stable images , were emitting weird " creaking " sounds one after another , swaying to a close to frenetic break dance before being reduced to a grimy death .
the overhead electrical cable lines were naturally unwilling to be left out , " bang " and broken , they scattered like whips in all directions .
and in front and behind of us , the raging earthquake demon was displaying its fireworks in celebration of its own creativity , the multi-colored flashes of earth light could compete with the visual effects of any major war film and the rumbling sounds from the ground , like the battle drumbeats , were torturing every fragile nerve tract .
there was only one thought in my mind : doomsday has already arrived for mankind !
i can imagine : the earth under my feet abruptly opens up , while the boiling magma issues a blazing invitation like the steel melt , mankind starts free-falling like mole crickets and ants in droves into the magna , too stingy to leave even a trace of blue smoke , all vanishing instantly .
my spine felt a pleasant numbness as if icy water was being injected ; the faces of my few companions were like paper masks floating in and out of the dimness .
i was thinking : was mankind just going to say goodbye to this colorful world this way ? were tens of thousands of years of civilization vanishing without a trace from this moment on ?
but i was not even 20 years old yet , the flowery youth had just blossomed , and the perception of joy in life was just forming , i was so reluctant to part from this beautiful life !
my parents and my loved ones , where are all of you , what are you doing , are you all still alive in this world ?
facing the sneering face of death at this moment , how i miss you !
.. i didn't know how much time had passed before the muddle-headed me finally discovered in joy that the sound coming from the ground was gradually weakening , with the shaking of the earth getting slower and slower , and the fireworks above my head were no longer scintillating .
a giant battleship tossing in the terrifying waves had finally sailed slowly into a tranquil harbor .
a young and fragile heart had finally been gingerly placed back into its original position after weathering through near insane havoc .
oh this earth , my homeland , you have finally let us feel the warmth and endearment of home once again !
a sense of blissfulness after surviving a calamity filled me up like a warm current from the bottom of my feet to my entire body .
facing what was once a cordial and warm youth section courtyard which had now become a wasteland of rubbles , yu doudou , who had just passed the age of 17 , steadied herself and suddenly burst out crying .
everyone was infected and hot tears flowed all over .
snow started to drop from the sky , was it condolence fluttering down for the misfortune of mankind ?
that year , the haicheng earthquake took away as many as 1,000 lives .
experts said : thanks to the timely prediction , and the fact that it occurred at a time when people were not asleep , otherwise a strong earthquake measuring 7.3 magnitudes would have taken at least the lives of 100,000 people !
merely a year apart , the tangshan earthquake erupted , and over 200,000 people died .
those matters in the village
there are many families in the village , among them is a nan family that is the most detestable . there is a well-known remark circulating in the village : beware of fire , beware of theft and beware of the nans .
in fact the whole family of nan is still rather honest in comparison .
some families will steal a melon or something from the land of others on normal days , and the members of the nan family are just committing petty theft , and the nans need not be isolated to the extent by everyone in the whole village .
everyone is not clean , who has been offended by members of my nan family ?
the nan family started organizing some very prestigious activities to show that this village was built initially by the ancestors of the nan family and that the nan family has always been a major family growing grains . in addition it has fostered some well-known individuals in history as well as contributed significantly to the building of this village .
at the same time , the members of the nan family have intimately invited the cadres of the village to their home to take a look and have a seat .
in short , the members of the nan family are very diligent , wanting to fight a proactive battle and striving to be powerful .
not long ago , the xi family did a very disgraceful thing , carrying out brutal persecution towards the seedlings of the nan family .
the xi family depends on matchmaking for their fame in the village , and all the young men in the village have benefited from the xi family .
if it hadn't been for the good matchmaking done by the xi family , how would all these families and households have been able to produce so well !
however this time round , the xi family actually used black bricks to crush the seedlings of the nan family at a place called hong dong . it was utterly despicable , and the whole village was infuriated , all remarking that there is no good person in the xi family .
the nan family demanded an explanation from the xi family , arousing the sympathy from everyone in the whole village .
everyone in the village spitted in the direction of the xi family .
hence , the battleground was relocated to the xi family .
the nan family is determined to create a good image prior to the 17th village meeting and let this most flourishing nan family prosper .
though the cadres of the village have daily advised everyone to live in harmony , this village called zhong is never peaceful .
the most repugnant thing is that in the short period of two to three months , even the pigs have started to clamor for revolt , demanding for a rise of their own value !
two years ago , when chickens suffered from flu in various villages , weren't they all killed ?
why don't you pigs have no brains ?
you can clamor for revolution , but you can't escape from being beheaded !
and mei village and ying village which are used to bullying people may not seem to be peaceful either , even though their days are well-off .
there were some vagrants , knocking down tall buildings in mei village today , and throwing some small explosive cans to the subway of ying village tomorrow , that is scary enough to people , isn't it ?
therefore , the people of zhong village generally feel that though it is disgusting not to be able to afford houses , treat their illnesses , or go to school , being able to peacefully do some farming , take on some work , and build up some relationship can be also considered stepping into the new era .
the nan family , and the xi family , ah , which family doesn't have their own undisclosed dilemmas ?
take for example members of the wan family residing at a little bend in the southeastern part of the village . though the head of this household is a little shameless , isn't it that our great zhong village still shelters this family just the same ?
with the 2008 all village sports meet to be held in our zhong village soon , save some energy on those trivial matters in the village and reform those delinquent children in the village .
all families and households , light up and start the fire . those who have money contribute with money , and those who have strength contribute with strength .
when the time comes , everyone goes to the village town hall to watch the golden egg being laid in the bird 's nest !
( dubbing outside the picture , weakening : golden egg or silver egg ? dear viewers , dear viewers , this is brother yong , the host of the village tv station .. )

strapless slippers
it is trendy to be topless for everything nowadays , especially in summer ; everyone can't wait to just run naked , because any kind of clothing would make people feel even hotter .
you may have known before that the t-back which has been trendy for years has already been beaten by g-string , because the latter is completely strapless .
therefore in such an era , the slippers that you are wearing may possibly be outdated already , because a new type of strapless slipper has now emerged . it has only a shoe sole .
how do you wear without straps ?
we are not supernatural beings , and the manufacturers have no magic .
such slippers directly .. stick to the soles of the feet : this is not a joking product , but a real product , and its selling price is us$ 13.5 per pair .
this is another one of those " i ever thought that it existed , but never thought that it really does exist " products , rendering people speechless .
manufacturers feel that such slippers are very cool , don't believe ?
please see : just looking at it already makes the soles of my feet feel extremely uncomfortable [ via f.c ]

keywords : lenovo , thinkpad
the thinkpad t61p that lenovo will be launching on july 17 ( us time ) will also be the most high-end notebook computer in the t-series , giving us a pretty nice surprise : uwb ( wisair ultra wideband ) .
correct , it is similar to the r400 notebook computer , connecting to a high speed wireless transmission expansion slot .
( via ) this 15.4 inch notebook computer model uses santa rosa cpu and nvidia quadro fx 570m graphics chipset , and of course there is surely the protective reinforced metallic cage type casing of t61 , yet the price is surprisingly affordable , at around rmb15,000 only .
watch a movie without a screen , blueprint of cellular phone projector exposed
keywords : cellular phone
iljin display , a south korean company , has launched a laser projector module with a size of a mere coin .
as the size of the module is extremely small , such projection module can even be installed inside a cellular phone , and a projection area about 7-inch in size can be seen on the wall .
( via ) a traditional projector consists of three different lcd panels , respectively responsible for emitting three different video signals of red , green and blue , while this mini type of projector only uses a single lcd panel to carry out conversion of the three colors , and this reduces the size and manufacturing costs of the projector .
official announcement states that the lcd panel of this projector is only 0.24 inch , and can be easily integrated into a cellular phone .
currently more than half of the cellular phones in the market have built-in cameras installed . it is estimated that before long cellular phones with built-in projector modules will emerge in the market , but it is really very hard to say if the market will favor it .
