( yesterday 's " new beijing news )
in the words of liu and resolute " service provider , " may be higher than the words of some of the system of appointing cadres " service " was even more real and more to convince people .
compared with direct appointment system for selecting the greatest advantage lies in that the former mainly by ordinary party members and masses to determine the source of power , and the latter mainly by the higher-level organization , while the direction of the source of power have decided that the former should be responsible for the people in the first place .
the source of power and the responsibility is decided to those elected how the fundamental factors in their work .
some people have questioned whether this kind of " democratic " more like a " democratic show . "
my view is that have this kind of " democratic " form than it is no good .
taking into consideration of china 's democratic politics at the grassroots level in the history and current situation . i believe that selecting direct is already a major breakthrough , democratic appraisal is an important part of this initiative for promoting the building of democratic politics at the grass-roots level should not be underestimated .

having said that , even if the role of the results ?
can check and deter official corruption ?
we cannot rule out the possibility that some timid , will take the initiative to confess , but she wouldn't that be even more how ?
not to mention the anti-corruption limits to the central discipline inspection commission and the results are remarkable , but it is another role to ;

the land was not privatization is the bottom line , i calm
[ foolish ] at a zen master 2007-07-02 10 : 34 : 39 [ sms ] [ tables ] .
the land was not privatization is the bottom line , i calm
i think it is not easy to get angry . at least i feel like this .
has the speeches at the forum are rational , mild , rarely have the time to lose rational nonsense .
has always maintain a high degree of confidence in the cpc central committee and ardent expectations . no matter how the reform measures not in my view , i can accept . one of these as " characteristics " .
but if the land started privatized ( or the privatization in disguised form ) , then all this will lose the basis for their existence .
ning lost 1000 armed forces is not only small patch of land and natural resources , is the largest social resources .
the ministry of land and resources , and the working people is the state 's fundamental .
as long as the nature of land and resources is not changed , the nature of this country is certainly not easy to change , once the nature of land and resources has changed , then basically what has changed .
i am not a communist party member , but i clearly remember that i had the following vowed : " love the motherland , love the people and learn how to properly tempered , and is ready to : contributions for the communist cause ! "
" to study diligently , work actively to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts , and to the cause of communism ! "
like me , was sworn in , and had to sing . " we are the successors to socialism " people . if he is still not enough shameless , then we should remember his oath .
if you have betrayed your own vows to please the magnanimous up from " communism " side go away . don't coax while holding label bullied the masses , while thought about how to sell this sign a good price .
of course , but is willing to all these worries are unnecessary . i hope i can always maintain a rational and calm .
we must remember that " we are the successors of socialism . "

a generation of people . the feelings between two eras
earlier , some people have proposed ; 30 years of age are crowded mao ?
it was later changed to 20 years old .
in fact , the people of this age group , did not experienced the mao zedong era , how to put the issue is brain was poured water is a congenital cerebral dementia .
in the city , against the scourge of the mao zedong era should be experienced by the people of that era is suffering in the suffering of the people , which is to say it should be -- between 1960 was born in 1950 .
they were born , parents to join the movement , not the relative love for their children .
they need to nutrition , happened to catch up with three years of natural disasters , the bitter suffering from hunger .
they began to go to school , hit again neglected their studies for a few years of the cultural revolution .
some even lifelong 15 - 17 of them finish their studies , academic is not yet complete , was forced to give up their studies , and respond to the call of the party , to the countryside , and support the border .
after they work , believes that the most glorious , voluntary choice of the working class is dirty and most tiring work .
glorious for a short time . a coward his life .
they have to get married , late marriage and late child from them to have one child .
the long wage is that enterprises stresses diploma . they no longer went without a diploma .
they have worked hard to children , and completed the basic education for children . the children admitted to university , and catch up with the reform of the education system and the reform of state-owned enterprises double ice cream , tuition fees , they laid off .
they have increased day by day with age , the body is sick , and unfortunately , catch up with the reform of the medical care system , causing the sick body , not because they can't afford medical treatment .
can see : the unfairness of the entire society , all the merciless down in their people of this generation .
however , in some of these people , but not much opposition to mao zedong to attack by mao zedong .
why ?
they are not being a lackey of mao zedong , and their flesh , real life of human groups in our society . they went to the countryside to laid-off and unemployed personal experience , historical , to face up to two social phenomenon of the times .
although they have abandoned their studies the mao zedong era , do not have enough to eat , clothes , and some unhealthy phenomena in society there are many dissatisfaction , or even hatred . however , from : the spirit of the nation , morals , and social atmosphere , they still believe that the era of mao zedong .

" injected watermelons . " cancer banana " and " cardboard buns . "
[ the wasteland ] at the great wall 2007-07-19 22 : 02 : 57 [ sms ] [ tables ] . i remember the year before last , there is news saying that hainan 's watermelons were used syringes will inject including chemicals . as a result , a large number of watermelon rotten in hainan province . the large melon lost everything .
central television later made follow-up reports . the results confirmed that no matter .
this report was very strange , because to a big watermelon use syringe injections . not only have no practical significance in terms of workload is also impossible .
last year 's memory is even more clear , and there were media reports that hainan banana trees persons with a similar to the disease of human cancer , inevitably banana trees died of illness .
the result was a lot of people misunderstand for eating bananas to cancer , and the result is still the same . bananas in hainan , and do a big drop in the price of sorrow and groaned repeatedly to banana farmers .
the reason why the above two reports have a sensation . the reason is due to its direct touched on the most sensitive nerves of the people that the roots , i.e. food safety issue .
if the media said that will endanger the health of certain food , then will certainly snapping it up right for the target involved , people generally adopt prefer to believe it , is not credible their attitude to a person , eat several hainan watermelons , banana and what , after all , it is nothing extraordinary , but the production and sale of those products are concerned , will be a big impact .
not long ago , broke out again in beijing on food safety material is that due to the surge in pork prices . some people even used the carton box after processing for stuffing production steamed buns , this is the cardboard buns .
i have heard that it was deeply shocked and felt that the hawkers . they too can research , could think of a way to make a killing methods , and will then disseminated , this , this , this news , warned that friends and family should no longer buy buns in the streets .
however , another news suddenly yesterday said that the report of the cardboard buns is a fake news , the entire matter is invented by one person . and so in at ease puzzled the media at the same time , how is today ?
himself from a reliable channel to understand the truth is that life in the beijing tv station channel " transparency " program team temporary personnel zi certain since brought from the market to buy hamburgers , flour and cardboard boxes and incite others boxes of health through the water , soak into hamburgers , produced by the arm steamed buns .
zi certain since the use of the opportunities brought a dv filmed the production process . it will then its editorial , to be broadcast by deception .
now the public security organs , have a wealth of the criminal suspects according to law on criminal detention and will handle it in accordance with the law .
steamed stuffed buns . after the incident , the government quickly organized relevant departments launched investigations and mounted a breakfast meeting in beijing on the market in an all-round and thorough inspection and ensure the safety of the people of the dining table .
after this incident was confirmed , beijing television has openly apologize to society , and a profound lesson , strictly investigate and deal with relevant responsible , and will further strengthen management , plug up loopholes , and resolutely eliminate false untrue news reports .
but although the cardboard buns are purely for ukraine , but when you dare to go buy confidently milkshakes steamed buns is still unknown .
the incident also reflects from one government attaches importance to the issue of food safety and swift action , to a certain extent , shows that the dining table of the people in beijing is still relatively safe , steamed buns incident a false alarm , is for everyone to put forward a wake up !
education should be responsible for whom ?
talking about the recent listening to friends in a school in the news , i cannot help feeling .
the event occurred in a private schools in shanghai , one of the southwest yuk secondary school .
the school has decided to the best teacher arrangements for three straight from the school 's contract in junior high school classes schooling , and several senior and no teaching experience in the past the poor performance of teaching young teachers to bring in several other schools entered from the outside or not signing the class to ascend to the school .
the reason is : the students about signed agreed to give up exam other high at the time , so that schools should , according to the agreement that giving them the best teacher .
several other classes of students , the attitude of the schools is : should the opportunity to a young teacher training .
this cannot help but i sigh that education , what is right and who is responsible for ?
remember many years ago a key high school students , all his classmates had a mathematics teacher teaching level . no matter whether the immensity to collective petition asked schools to replace the teacher .
after the school to really give we changed the teacher , because schools to our commitment is to each students equally to each student .
ten years of graduate students came to the united states .
one summer courses in the next term , i discovered that all the elective course arrangements faculty are theoretical strong courses , while some applications . one of the programmes are no arrangements .
i went to find the remarks of the department , i believe that the curriculum .
the recognition of the department of applied not set the course because of the shortage of teachers . after two years as a teacher , that can be opened .
i remember that at the time he said : " this is your question , not me .
i traveled afar from shanghai to your school to study . it is because you are attracted by the course of employment .
if you have no ability to the creation of these courses , don't put them on . otherwise , this is false advertising is for me and my family irresponsible " .
department head listened to me think i said : i look at how to solve it .
may have already too late , because all the courses have been arranged in online registration .
after three weeks , talked to me , the head of the gist of the story is told me that his work is to each student , including my responsibility .
he listened to my proposal is the best , an increase of two mun applied strong elective courses , and hope that i can understand .
after the occurrence of this incident , i took a few classes of the department .
he never because i mention the views on him and i have prejudice , each class is just to give my a.
on the eve of graduation , i heard that his secretary , said , " every student has the best , but not every student has grateful to him .
at the graduation ceremony , i , as honorary students to the deputies ' speeches , told the department head : we all have to thank him from the bottom of their hearts to all we have done , because he tried his best to each and every one of us .
i felt that i made the right choice in life to go to school here .
here , i see that there are hidden in the eyes of the department of tears . . . if one day , every chinese educators and the whole education system can do that for every student , i think china 's real takeoff , the days that will not be far off .
central ' real takeoff ny pronouncement that the days that will not be far off 4s volleyball tournament
last sunday attended the system of the four people in the central area of new york men 's volleyball tournament . the six and a half hours to our team final to win the championship .
this competition is actually in order to prepare for the summer games in new york , new york ( empire games ) , diplomatically , and training the volleyball tournament .
coach to new york 's central region four men 's teams ( high squadron , university team over 35 teams , age 45 team ) scatter , restructuring 34 people a team , each equipped with a setter for competition .
the rules of the competition is very interesting , and can only back-row attack can not lobber line to three meters , only one of the setter block not change .
so basically is to test the strength of storming and defensive judgment card .
our team had a 41.65 2 meters , is the strong points of attack is high points , more than 60 percent of the overall offensive and scores of everything by him , one of the setter 85 meters , many dams single block to death .
a 90 meters in the back row , deputy attack , attack errors .
that is , i , 75 meters in the main , sometimes sneak attack . the success rate is still the main spiker he can , each received hatched markings .
a total of seven teams . the first round , my team first winning a referee after repeated sentenced to step on the line when our supply offensive fouls and greatly affect the morale of our side , immediately crying lost 3 .
however , after losing everyone psychological also quiet support is also among the three reached a stable . thus began to victory in a row .
after the preliminaries , my team three negative , small three wins in the 8th place .
then began to additional . apart from the top teams , two to seven catch to qualify for the team .
my team psychological , tactical stability is to eat up strong , leading the way in the semi-finals .
semifinal opponents , weak to strong guarding against my arm green and purple . however , once took a heavy detained . the extent of joy is the success of the detained two times the players .
did not know how many won the final score .
the final match meant that many drivers break attack on our side , leading the way .
the last 21 : 24 , our side confers match point , each other even sent two all called me to fly received the ball , 23 , 24 , my team 's supply ran over and said to me , it's only just two goals .
the next ball " is also flew to me . i am pretty well received . the back of the setter transmitted to supply , a heavy detained solution to combat .
besides on moral
freedom of the scattered individuals , " said on moral has said many .
in this regard , i have nothing to say .
now i want to say is on the collective .
often we will encounter requires a collective occasions .
on these occasions , it is necessary for a collective certain moral .
we often can those successful collective find some very good moral .
this is not accidental .
because for these enterprises or activities are concerned , it is necessary to overcome the difficulties of some of the eyes . together , excluding those based on factors of belief , i think that is those good moral has also had a role not to be neglected .
the most basic point , a group of moral criteria are very low , people are together very difficult to make the event a success , and are very sure to predict .
perhaps this is because , through rational long-term perspective to forward the wisdom of interests is a collective successful must quality .
in fact , collective often receive this all kinds of ways . for example , a local slang , beliefs , and so on , and moral integrity .
only brandy , brandy at night in the morning , the road of life can orchids everywhere .
[ explore ] to live until now , the real fun has had several ?

propaganda and publicity at tokyo university institute of architecture
ha ha , is also considered to introduce the introduction of the alumni of tokyo university 's school of architecture .
i feel that the latest first-hand information to be genuine .
wang , the secretary of the president of the personnel teacher li also have several other scientific research and teaching office building technology teachers attended the report , i talked about a hours , then everyone talked about one and a half hours .
after the formal report , teacher zhang ( , assistant to the president ) off to the side me , and i said to the office of behind america to talk about .
he was very courteous , closing the door to tell me that in formal meeting , some words not good said , he said , " we can see that my future revenue late , so tell me some on the specific conditions of the income of a teacher 's school of architecture , so i feel at ease .
wang yuan before in the report on the general situation , the national institute of architecture , the construction sector only had a total of six key disciplines , two at tokyo university , and tsinghua university , tongji 1 , 2 , 1 , in addition to you .
he said that in recent years the country attaches special importance to building energy saving , green building and construction technology , southeast university wanted to introduce a teacher in this respect .
he said that they had received more than 20 biographical notes in the direction of applications in the country , japan , the united states ( it was like me a ) .
institute of architecture attached great importance to , and also for these applicants made conscientious observation .
and my understanding compared with some other colleges and universities , southeast university institute of architecture is indeed quite leading with chai urban planning should be given more than tokyo university , but the direction from the architectural design , seems to tokyo university can also accounted for a little bit first ( , um , i had never thought that ) .
wang yuan said that in the past two years , the research institute of architecture is adequate , belongs to the state institute of 985 construction of the project .
he told me that last year , the top one-time call todai construction funds for the construction of 10 million , of which 3.5 million was used to buy books enrich architectural college professional library , oh , this , i must sanichi , expense !
) . the remaining had almost all been used to buy my professional direction experimental equipment .
it is said to have several academicians .
ha ha great~~~ mentioned in passing that point , some of the equipment imports , i feel that seems to be slaughtered .
a survey indoor room air confined sexual experimental systems , is very common in the united states , the estimated 500 dollars definitely win . as a result , the southeast university spent 50,000 yuan ! ! !
other situation . now many of the southeast university faculties have moved to 9 longhu went to the new campus , but firmly behind , school of architecture , that is to enable students to have a good atmosphere of architecture , the old school district can have a look at some classic buildings , and had nothing new campus .
ha ha great~~~ seemed because other departments were removed , institute of architecture also want a house .
so wang yuan , coming straight to the told me that can give my allocation office alone .
very embarrassed , wang yuan , said : this time , i didn't . what feeling .
later my side of teacher zhang told me that this is no easy , because the office staff quota is extremely tense , and that some old professors have no separate office .
this made it my very uneasy . it seems that is not understanding the national situation .
in short , right ? this trip to tokyo university . i had a very pleasant and the leadership of the tokyo school of architecture and related professional and enthusiasm of the performance of the teacher , left me a very good impression .
i wish smooth development at tokyo university , the institute of architecture to continue to maintain the leading !

nanjing subway drivers should accept the psychological debug
keyword : psychological debug
according to xinhua news agency , july 3 , together with the nanjing subway lying unconscious on the death of track .
according to the description , " zhu zhengting , aged 22 , is a young mtr drivers , encountered the scene as a nightmare . yesterday , the reporter saw him , he does not seem to have been from fear calmer , sits in a chair , staring straight , and seemed a bit trance-like eyes . "
obviously , the spirit of the young driver received great impact in urgent need of a psychological debug . otherwise , misleading for life .
don't know whether you remember that more than 10 years ago , a certain abandoned in texas , chau wells and rescued a little girl who rescue personnel , have withstood long-term psychological torment , finally choose to commit suicide after painful life .
at that time , although he too simple psychological debug . however , because people to pay more attention to the little girl was saved is precisely to overlook the need to psychological debug . finally , could not avoid the tragedy .
similarly , the incident of illegal immigrants at dover strait several years ago , that first opened the container , the british police . it is said that he was frightened fainted .
later , the british side to him for more than two months before the psychological debug he resumed normal .
people in the disastrous stimulate , psychological will greatly harm alone of personal strength at this time it is difficult for them to thoroughly restored , and often left psychological wounds .
due to such injuries are hard to be found by outsiders , but found that has no choice . many of the victims will be painful for life .
however , in china 's people 's psychological trauma care is not enough , especially the families of the parties or departments is often lost after the best 14.8 suddenly , i think at that time it was already too late .
now , the diversification of the media , we often heard that some shocking incident , many women have harmed the young people , many young children witnessed the cruel injuries suffered by their own parents .
in these young people were rescued , and very rarely heard that they have a psychological treatment , is more from family to family solace .
although the victims can feel that they have security . but once the harm it has become a piece of the scars will forever be impossible to cure , and always be awakened , affects the life of the parties .
fortunately , the driver 's leadership promptly his consolation to ease the pressure of his spirit .
after all , the responsibility of the accident is not to drivers , but the driver found that the situation has also taken steps to do what he has done , but did not stop the tragedy .
believe that even if they are not concerned drivers , anyone would be at the scene was shocked at the accident scene .
however , others have no responsibility involved with suicide . although were shocked , and to the development of the time will gradually faded from memory .
drivers of concerned is not so lucky . he must remember that is likely to remember all my life .
if he can extricate themselves from the then he went to wan . if there is no way to break , he would often was tortured by this startled .
the concept of modern health comprehensive more than in the past , mental health began to be people 's attention .
regrettably , the situation of the human spirit is very disheartening , especially in the cities , people 's mental health is not ideal , and the majority of people have more or less a hidden dangers in spirit , but some people encountered problems have sufficient attention .
think of the previous stage , " ms yang incident " lessons ? some irresponsible to the media the torment of a mental problem patients treated as objects of speculation , causing very bad social impact .
should avoid the occurrence of such incidents in the future it . otherwise , our society would become a pathological society .

music and make friends with star fans
keyword : star fans
i have a female friend had never seen before .
i directly told her that i appreciate your !
because you have direct express your love .
she likes to a stall in taiwan when the male red entertainment programmes , but these feelings never conceal .
this male presided over in jinan , presided over the program , she flew to jinan ; this man presided over to cheung sha easy-acting . she flew to cheung sha .
the book and men said that a friend sent to own a no bullets slingshots . she told me in a pleasant surprise " that sling is me . "
she also participated in a star in the electronic magazine , she told me excitedly each .
i have been quite like some of his own frank exchanges between the people of a certain star fans .
these stars can be a movie star . it can be a player , and also can of course is a great man .
i never think that these friends superficial , i feel they are very cute .
these people are really temperament , like is like , and does not like to do not like .
with this type of people contacts would be very relaxed .
although they are not 100 % consider to your feelings , but at least you know that their joys and sorrows . also know that contact with them . there will be more secure .
these people are also very frank .
we should know that dare to express their love , is also requires courage .
it is for this reason that many people only quietly like an entire life , or he will have looked down on those brazenly said that is so fans .
frank is , i think that one of the biggest advantages to his friends and frank and sincere .
but this is actually very difficult .
can like a star , has proved that a selfless ingredients in his heart .
some of my friends are some fans of the stars .
sometimes in order to see the stars side . they are able to endure hardship , and would sacrifice , give cards pinched his hand in hand , according to the camera , his mouth still cry .
can be said that they are very stupid , naive , but could not return on a plan to love a person is need selfless .
because in reality their narcissistic , insist on the object of others is too much , too much , so this selfless seemed a bit precious .
therefore , when talking about the people , and said that their own favorite stars is so and so , if a said that i never worship of others .
ha , ha , ha , so careful .
zhang xiaohui qiren
keyword : zhang xiaohui
chance to see not seen for a period of " kang xi . " the main character is zhang xiaohui .
wants is to publicize the " romance . " at that time .
see " romance . " at that time i was addicted to the days of sex films .
at that time i felt very strange , and pornographic films could be so beautiful , and sometimes are very interesting , called sex films .
i think in fact , it is not the erotic films , but also covers many countries .
the first to come in contact with south korea and japan .
later i saw many third world countries , latin america , some european , but rarely see hollywood and the french film .
i did not willing to the computer was deleted two . one is the " youth " . one is that " romance . "
" the first half of romance " are quite good . everyone is new , played very hard , and the director are measured .
the latter was abnormal , i fully accept .
in fact , i want to say is that , zhang xiaohui in the program said that her boyfriend , almost cover all the countries in the world . apart from africa .
at present , she has four her boyfriend .
most people are afraid of this issue could not accept that will say this person flouters .
but the problem is that when she said that these problems are very frank , not the slightest uncomfortable expression to people .
she also said that his own view of love .
for example , the two sides economic independence .
i estimate that character are also to be independent and to control their own destiny .
because i know that in love , love is alive . since the private , how will allow themselves to love also accept others ' love .
according to my experience as well as assumptions , presumably zhang xiao hui love has a simple wistful romances portrayed . she is a typical love between older sister and younger brother .
love between older sister and younger brother and sister is can accept everything , including also has a few younger brother , and at the same time , the infinite attachment to his younger brother and sister , because each other 's charm , and maternal , but may not mind whether it is the only , and so on .
but the statement from zhang xiaohui , i have found that she is actually a very understand life .
for example , she are keen to travel to the extent of extravagant technique .
therefore , i have every reason to believe that her life is very exciting .
if it was to , i am afraid that it could not accept such a phenomenon .
for now , i have accepted many people with no tolerance of tolerance , in fact , this is not a relationship , but only to their own roots thought that the tendons , there is no absolute love or do not love .
these people , for example , friends from passers-by a , b , and zhang ziyi , his good friend c , and sister lotus .
look at other people 's life , he is watching and visitors to his own life , for other people , then isn't it the heroine ?
this is like . although i am not in the jianghu , but the jianghu has been my legend .

for example , went to the " entertainment " version of the ends of the eight trigrams and relax .
inside , speak out freely , but of course you should have the capability of differentiating between right and wrong , because all kinds of " black " .

small and/or said that tsai kang yong " scholar . "
if i can , well , that is of that type of reading a book , but has not thoroughly type .
fortunately , i always have self-knowledge .
however , just in time to read this book . i have some of the things they want .
also , it happened that i also like the blind , they were reading to think about , but also many things in common . there are many things that the seashore .
therefore , it gradually formed the habit of some habits , for example , tell yourself to their strong point to point of others .
every thing problems . first , from their own bodies to find the reasons ;
treat things rational point , treat friendly sentimental point ;
have to keep a low profile , and things to a low profile .
but you know that were not so good , association , selfish , and consider their own gains and losses . the federation of association the rational , emotional into a mess , the emotional tmd rational to life again .
that is , in dealing with its own choice will not want to regret it .
done is done , the plant will admit it .
people want to do so many useless .
fortunately , he himself is not really like to face up to the board , improve their reading personal price . he is also a vulgar .
but some people is different because not angry , always rational .
or , for example , their own sense of values is particularly strong .
once the trust a person , so all i felt that it was good .
even if there is insufficient , is also willing to go to tolerance .
though it was not the kind of " is put to friends thought of category .
but because of his friends are quite strict checks .
i don't understand . now , why do so many people are so trust the words and deeds of the newspaper .
also , or in their hearts . now , the report also and that kind of sacred nature as before .
but in this world , i don't understand the , uh , more than the matter .
a joke .

song dandan " the depths of happiness , " warm and moved
keyword : song dandan , the depths of happiness
earlier , read in the newspaper to song dandan new published a book called " the depths of happiness . "
really want to read .
because i think as a to this age , have this kind of professional and experienced the changes in the family and career . after that , her own , what is the view of life ?
indeed do not disappoint people . after reading it , have feelings about two points : first , i was -- to look at other people 's life , you can also see their shadows ; second , is also very moved . all these are the details of family .
why was ) ?
in the book , song dandan , wrote : " i ignore an important principle in life : to give than to accept more happiness .
i always busy giving , busy let their own happiness .
i fuwa too understand how to accept , i ignore him to give is that ignore the happiness . the rights of others . "
i discovered that i was always enjoy this happiness , perhaps we should pay attention to some .
if a person can calmly face their own in the past , will all these demonstrated in front of everybody , this requires courage .
there , including her first love , she and the failure of yingda marriage as well as its own analyze in depth , and the son of the family .
this book is commendable , because as a publishing house , presumably originally vigorously advocating that she came to focus on the " i love my home " and " ambush from all sides " , and the case of a series of short zhao benshan .
but , presumably her persist , only the last raised zhao benshan . as for " ambush from all sides " and " i love my home " almost did not mention .
the book is filled with a woman , aged 40 , and the love of life and the family , the family rituals , warm and moved .
busy holiday
keyword : holiday busy
nearly a week on vacation , has not idle .
to institute a will and should be prepared to go to the meeting next week materials and the texts of the meeting .
this holiday will be very busy .
if no accidents occurred , according to the plan , three out of the meeting , 45 cities to go .
life was suddenly filled with many of its contents . similar , different types of almost forgotten how did before the holidays .
seemed to memory , and also did not idle .
only had a very long time can own spending , while it seems less time this year .
good or bad ?
busy , will enrich some , but if no gain , they have no effect on reducing the significance of this busy .
but , as if life cannot be calculated in accordance with the results . life is used to slowly feelings , and secure stable enrich joy is also a kind of harvest . although this harvest sometimes cannot be used to measure the evaluation standard for the community .
everybody needs to social values and self values . if the two can't be chinese , and we will ?
we should take the social value of the guidance of marxism , and advocated to make contributions to society . however , the fact is that a healthy , sound social , should fully respect the aspirations and value of the individual choice , and create conditions for the realization of the value of the individual .
of these , more and more thought suddenly discovered that the marxist principles also really effective .
the reason is indeed such a word , but really to real life , people sometimes will still puzzled .
even if the realization of their own value do not hinder social values , but the reality of each individual , will also meet in the realization of their true selves , and in disregard of society ?
or , our sense of self-esteem , can leave the social comments off ?
it seems difficult .
therefore , every one of us to do a good job of an ordinary person , they also avoid the pursuit of unusual and beyond ; if it has squandered a life but also association since accountability .
this is probably the social aspect .
vacation came . it is easy to some extent .
at least , can have time to see little discs , can relax their efforts to play a recently .
casual , the work still needs to do , life is still photos .
xi'an again next week for a meeting .
a although i have never been to , but because some " prejudice " doesn't seem like very much in the city .
he hoped that the visit can be changed , i have the impression that this city 吼吼 .

for example , his father to allow me to rub a little old houses chimneys nai , i he climbed onto the roof of the operation .
wipe chimneys is good , but when the rain . the house was dew . the reason is i have room tiles foot was broken .
another example is that his father to let i changed , that kind of old incandescent light bulbs .

such examples . so when brother-in-law to wrangle , these small work was chop suey , of course he had contracted extremely beautiful , but do not need to pay any labor costs .
i was the music was not hide in a corner of a watch those brick 闲书 .
later , we have long become two trees two trees enough to support a family tree in xiamen .

this is the trees two trees , the wind and rain of experience that we have been able to calm in the face of all kinds of hardships and also needs and i explain ?
it doesn't seem that necessary .
because you understand : you left , sister , and sister and your children . there is also this big family , can only rely on the support of this tree alone .
positioned for men who called ?
a man , no matter whether you are willing to , you should not hesitate to confront the spine and borne the responsibility .
the only regret is : why did you , the tree withered very early , you should have an abundant verdant life ?
when you walk on the day of the lunar new year .
is that the chinese all over the world to greet spring festival at the boundless joy , a lonely .
perhaps , in another time and space , and a new scion of life ?
the saluted the minutes of life
the reason for such a seemingly fashion the title is because at that time of extreme despair , confused the fundamental too busy to the brain .
if an innocent , vacuum received the ruling of the death of paper , he also went to knowing chuckles picky about the " judgment ming bridal book " inside the grammatical errors ?
it was a very cold in winter , the youth points .
did not know who the duty , without a lighting the stove .
because of the strong earthquake that evening legends back to wo , we also didn't bother to set fire to the health .
in the 12 individual chase to sleep on the long , we are wrapped in quilts , four people in the fading light of dusk the howling shivering playing " striking at three things , " win meal ticket .
suddenly , a far and near voice came rolling in , a few of us provide feedback to look only at the moment , immediately realized the presence of disaster .
thus get rid of playing cards to fly in the hands of local fishermen , the two road through the narrow door , a crowded .
at the moment , we ran out of the dormitory that poor base with stones into the moment the cottages into fragment powder .
rushed to the courtyard we just stood on a shaky , like tumbler on board the same rock with laughter , unable to their own fixed .
in this within a few seconds , we all around building was the glory and steady image , and issued a " strange called by " it incessantly squeaks , jump up nearly mad , writes , and then turned into shares . dust from excavated the site .
the wire jumped out of the limelight , " foreign exchange earner of nature , " have the same whip circumfusion fled .
in our rampant after the predecessor body zhen magic is to release the celebrating their creativity , colorful fireworks 地光 with comparable to any large scenography effects of war , the rumbling sounds of drums , suffering like to cheer on the weak nerves every roots .
at the time , only an idea : mankind 's doomsday has arrived !
i can imagine : the earth ran now-open sound of a crash , and boiling like as molten steel lava issued a blazing human like ants , at the invitation of the way to freeimage design co. have invested within the lava , too stingy to a trace of tsing cigarettes have not suddenly disappeared .
my spine have injected like ice water carefree feeling numb , dark face several companions such as paper masks , erratic .
i think : this way of mankind and the colorful world bid farewell to ? then will disappear from tens of thousands of years of civilization ?
can i still don't have a full 20 years old , the flowers just blossoming of youth , the survival just perception . i am very pleased , reluctant to beautiful life !
my family and my parents , uh , you are and where you are now are , what in the world still survive ?
the moment the ferocious smiling face death . i was how i miss you !
.. don't know too long , and are goofing away , i finally found joy : to the weakening of the voice is a little bit , shaking the earth is a little is slowing down , while the fireworks at the head of the flashing .
a jolt the destroyer in the rough finally coolly and enter a peaceful and safe harbour .
the heart of a young and fragile after nearly mad careful after the devastation was finally returned to the original location .
ah , my homeland of the earth , you finally let us to feel the sweetness of family and cordial !
a kind of the sense of happiness as warm slowly overflow from the feet full body .
, who just turned 17 years old in a firm foothold in doudou , facing the courtyard at once the warmth of the youth of harmony , and now it is a piece of italian troops will remain in the rubble , suddenly weeping uncontrollably .
all of them were infected , crosscurrent tears .
snow began to fall , the sky is not fortunately the 120-foot condolences of mankind ?
that year , a total of an earthquake took the lives of thousands of people .
some experts said : fortunately forecast and , moreover , occurred in people have yet to sleep , otherwise " july 3 " an earthquake measuring at least 100,000 lives away !
separated by only a year , the outbreak of the tangshan earthquake , more than 20 million people died .
